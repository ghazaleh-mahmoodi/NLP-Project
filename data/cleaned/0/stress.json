I've also seen people split water into hydrogen and oxygen by simply allowing some current to flow through the water - and often it causes explosions or fires, because hydrogen is flammable.\n\nI thought nerve cells and muscle cells just used chemicals and proteins to transmit signals and make things move, and not actual electricity like out of a high-tension power line.. it makes me really anxious because i used to have seizures and they could come back any time, actually i get muscle twitches all day every day, they are seizure-like but may not be caused by epilepsy. now whenever i get those twitches i think those wires are short circuiting and im going to suddenly see sparks come off my skin and set my clothes on fire. or my leg will suddenly heat up and cook itself from short circuiting and ill catch on fire. also what if my nerves malfunction and short circuit, and i shake a friend's hand and i electrocute them to death or something? i wouldnt be able to live with that\n\ni havent slept for days bc i keep thinking of this and doing research on it is only confirming my fears i feel like i want to literally rip all my nerves out my body",

It's like when I saw him, there was this INSTANT interest\/bond.\n\nEver since, it's like I HAVE to learn everything about him, even the most minute detail like his favorite color, what his medical history is, details about his job (Prison Warden) his political views, birthday (December 25th) everything, and they're quite similar to mine. When I found out what his full name was, I was literally giddy and in a daze for a couple days.\n\nJust seeing the videos he's made makes me happy, I can be really stressed out or just feeling depressed, or anxious. But then he makes me feel better. He's super dorky but I find that adorable, he has this kind of charming energy and a voice that I find soothing. (He sounds exactly like Jello Biafra)\n\nI haven't met him in person yet, but I hope to eventually. He isn't exactly a friendly person all of the time, he can be an asshole to people at times. I remember impulsively going full-hate mode on him when he said that he hated children. Then I snapped out of it..But I'm still attached to him and sometimes he even finds his way into my dreams then I get upset because it seems real.\n\nHe comes into my mind several times a day, like during dinner time I think, hmm I wonder what he's eating for dinner, or wondering when he's got home from work, when he'll be sleeping and then imagining him nice and comfy in bed. I wonder how he's doing right now.\n\nI've had these horrible nightmares where I'll dream that he died and I'd wake up literally sobbing, if he died I can't imagine how depressed I'd feel. It makes me feel physically sick to imagine anything happening to him. I had this dream where he was found dead in a pit of spikes and there was blood everywhere and his eyes and mouth were wide open. Then I felt him and he was freezing cold.. It messed me up for days\n\nI keep feeling nauseous whenever I think about him like I've been on a rollercoaster or something.\n\nProblem is...I have no way of directly contacting him and I'm not even sure if he'd want me as a friend or not. I don't know what to do and I don't feel like I want to discuss this with a doctor in person, because I'd seem crazy and stalker-ish.",

My family is so conservative and they don't want me to wear short dresses, have guy friends and not even close girl friends. So I had always been oppressed and as a result I'm less expressive and I'm also less social and my this behaviour bothers my family a lot. And my brother too is closed minded so, I don't have a choice but keep secrets that I do wear short dress when I'm out and I've a boyfriend. I had the habit of writing diaries and it was something that always helped me to be calm, feel light, control my anxiety. I'd to feel my diary as someone just mine and I'd write anything in there. My every feelings, everything I had ever to say, and everything I never wanted anyone to know. But my brother that always been curious about my life, I used to think it's cause he cares about me, but he stalking be on social media was really making me anxious, so I blocked him. Later he suddenly stopped talking to me, and I kept thinking what wrong did I do. Later my mom told me that he read my diary, that broke me, med me feel exposed ( I wasn't doing anything wrong in my life, I used to be just myself, atleast while writing my diary) and he read it all. He was supposed to know the things he read. I was so disappointed, so frustrated, so angry and it still makes me anxious now and then. But I couldn't gather courage to question him. I fear he'll question me about why do I do things he doesn't want me to do. And Ik I should fight and I can complain against him if he tries to hurt me, but the place where I live, the process is so hard, I'll always be blamed and idk what to do. He didn't have any right to read my personal diary, I atleast expected him to have that much sense. And the worst part is, I can't write anymore. I tried writing on my diary after that, but I just couldn't. Ig the fear is still there, I feel like it won't help me anymore, I can't just mek it. I feel like it's no more something of my own. And I feel more frustrated now, I'm more anxious now. And idk what should I do. I'm recently thinking maybe I'll leave that diary just aside and my myself and new diary and keep a lock in it and try writing in it. Coz it's hard to go though stuffs and not being able to take it out. I don't have enough friends either with whom I can talk about anything without feeling judged. \n\nWhat do you all think?

        "14":"Hi folks I wanna reveal in this post what is the most important cause behind your Psychological challenges, starting from your procrastination, self sabotaging, Anxiety, failed Relationships .. \nWell as humans we do anything we could to feel like we're in control of our daily lives, the moment this sense of control started to get challeged spontaneously we resist and fight back to regain this control that we use to feel inside, because falsely we thought this is the only way to feel secure and successful, but as we know if we get to dig a little bit deeper on how life and this universe operates, we will discover that there's order and chaos as a core principal in this universe, in other words if you're always doing your best to eliminate chaos aka tension and life's challeges from your life, you'll start to deny an important part inside yourself which is the desire to evolve with world around you .. and that's the starting of all Psychological pathologies .. \n\nbasically your internal resistance to your life condition and reality is what getting you to suffer and feel depressed and anxious, if you just embrace life as it is by accepting it how it is, without any expectations or the desire to control your surroundings .. you'll feel peace and sense of security Inside your psyche, suddenly your true self aka your authentic self will comes out and the reward of being able to achieve that is you'll be able to do things effortlessly without draining a big part of your energy on resisting or combating your Emotions about what is going on around you .. \n\nHope you like this post for further discussions DM me guys for any questions",

        "20":"I wanna start off my saying a bit about me. I'm a 19 year old \\[male\\]  in first year of uni -(Maths&amp;Physics) and I've: played the piano since I was six, produce music (some of which is now on spotify) and i am a \"triathlete\" (train 12-15 hours\/week) ps. running is my entire life - though I'm not great at it yet.\n\nMy flatmate, Wendy, is one of my best friends. Over the pandemic we spent around 5 months living on our own (in the same bed since not in uni halls) and everything was great. I have never been in a relationship and I am not ready for one, I made that crystal clear to her before I even invited her to stay with me over the 5 months. We had somewhat a physical relationship, though we never had sex. She asked why and the main was because I didn't want to lead her on, I told her that and would regularly check if she was okay living with me despite not having an emotional relationship - I know that wouldn't work for some people and I really liked spending my time with her. Throughout this time I didn't see anybody from uni (I was home) though I kept in close contact with a girl called Lisa. I picked up a few running and cycling injuries and had to give up training for a few weeks and it fucking broke me (still recovering, but doing much better).\n\nRecently, Wendy told me she is in love with me. I friendzoned her and immediately stopped anything physical that we had ever done - I really want this friendship to work. But she is NOT okay. i have spent 3 nights over the past two weeks (where I go to sleep at 4am, waking up at 7am for training) with her as she's having a panic attack . I am trying everything I can. She is now back home since my mum (a qualified counsellor) conviced here that staying in uni is not a good idea - though Wendy wouldn't listen to me when I said it.\n\nOn top of this, my cycling injury is now back and I am picking up a bad shoulder from swimming and S&amp;C work. Music rooms aren't open and so I haven't practiced piano in a month (which is a big fucking deal). I can't run\/cycle\/swim how I would like to, I can't practice music and I have no motivation to produce. I hate my uni degree (it's really hard and i have no motivation) though I know when out of this rut I will begin to enjoy it again. And, worst of all, I can't stop thinking about Lisa. I thought I didn't want a relationship but she is fucking everything to me. What is Wendy gonna do when she knows how I feel about Lisa? I'm scared she's gonna do something severe. I don't know if I'm falling inlove with Lisa but all I know is that I would die for her.\n\nYou're probably wondering why I have titled this what I have, but I can do a lot of great things (cocky, I know) and yet I still look in the mirror and see a 'failure'. I just want to be satisfied with who I am but I have no love for myself. I have dealt with \"depression\" (not really, but feeling constantly down for months on end) and a developing ED which I have now overcome - I don't want it to come back.\n\nps. I can't talk about this in person, I have not told anybody how I feel, I have tried so many times but I just see it as weak and pathetic (never cried infront of anyone sober either).",

My muscles ache or problems with my bowel.\n- Mentally I have no concentration to do normal thinking, analysing or problem solving. Watching\/reading\/listen is just a no go.\n- Emotionally I cry often when an emotion pops up. I can't control my emotions, they take over.\n- My motivation\/perseverance is minimal to not there at all, I can hardly take care of myself (eat, drink, hygiene) so doing things I want or need to do are just out of the question.\n\nWhen I'm in this fase I'm out. I just can sleep, I walk because I need to and I'm happy my parents provide me with food.\n\n**Making my own stress thermometer**\n\nI made a chart where I put the 4 measures next to each other and made 4 rows under it:\n\n- RED: burn out \ud83d\ude2b\n- ORANGE: stressed \ud83d\ude16\n- YELLOW: minor stressed \ud83d\ude1e\n- GREEN: peaceful \ud83d\ude0c\n\nIn every cell I put indicators.

In orange I loose motivation.\n\nThis way I can track my daily stress level.\n\n**Origin of my stress**\n\nI know I have some beliefs and expectations that cause me to ignore my feelings of need for rest.\n\nIt feels like the emotions of the beliefs and expectations are prioritised higher then my feeling of tiredness. Actually my whole wellbeing is prioritised less then my beliefs and expectations.\n\n**How I plan to recover**\n\nI'm resting right now, I'm lucky I get the time from my job to be sick and get paid leave.\n\nDaily I rest, walk, attend to my plants, clean up my house, I try to do at least 2 or 3 small tasks which I know are good for my wellbeing even though it can be hard.\n\nI'm mindful, I meditate and I'm very aware of my emotions. When they pop up I try to understand what belief or expectation is behind the emotions. When they pop up when I need to make a difficult choice I choose rationally for my wellbeing. Rest, rest and more rest (physical, mental and emotional). Even though it takes a lot of courage to overcome the emotions I get not listening to my beliefs and expectations.\n\nI'm not helping anybody when I can't even do things for myself!\n\nAfter making a choices like this: I get proud of myself because I choose me \ud83e\udd73\n\n**Motivation and perseverance**\n\nI have noticed that my motivation and perseverance grows when I'm more rested again \ud83d\ude03 So, I started to do things that I love to do and give me satisfaction.",

All started when my taste and smell senses decreased a lot for a few weeks, took 3 covid tests and all negative. During the same time my right arm started to hurt, then my right leg and some time later my whole right side of body went numb (not like paralized numb but skin feels numb and tight). I also have buzzing in my arm and leg and my fingers feel stiff (a few days ago my little toe in right leg went numb too - like really can\u2019t move it). And my jaw hurts a lot on the right side - that jaw thing has been going of for the last year, dentists say nothing is wrong. I noticed that I clenched my teeth sometimes so thought that maybe I am just so stressed and this is the outcome. But right now I don\u2019t clench my teeth but my jaw pain is still back (with all these new symptoms). Anyway I have been to my doctor and neurologist and right now I am waiting for MRIs (neuro wants to eliminate MS). When this all first started I didn\u2019t feel more stressed or anything but now of course I am stressed. I feel kinda fine some days and then the other days (like today) my arm and leg are in so much pain (I think nerve pain, my skin feels very sensitive and almost painful to touch too) and I just feel so weak and tired and only want to stay in bed and feel like I want to cry. \nSo I guess my question is that could all these symptoms be because of stress or anxiety? My neuro seems nice but all the other doctors seemed to think and said that \u201cmaybe you are just stressed\u201d. Of course I don\u2019t want to get diagnose like MS from my neuro but at the same time I really would not want to believe that just stress could cause these kind of symptoms.

The symptoms I have are 24\/7 and started in October of 2020 after I got my top wisdom teeth removed. I was not sedated or put to sleep as they were not impacted. This was also a very very stressful time due to covid, losing my job, being on awful unemployment etc. \n\nSince this time I have had 24\/7 head pressure felt mainly in the top back of my head. If I wiggle\/lift my ears or raise my eyebrows I feel the pressure originating from this top back crown area but my whole head feels heavy all the time. Nothing makes it worse\/better. Along with this comes horrible brain fog and lightheadedness. I constantly feel spacey\/woozy kind of like I'm outside my body or off in gravity. I have recently noticed that the more active I try to be (When I try to workout) the more spacier and off I feel. It's not that I'm going to fall but moreso my space in gravity is just off. My vision is also blurry when looking at a computer screen or tv or just in general, like if I have to fill out papers my vision is blurry and off. My vision feels like it's constantly spazzing, like nothing is sharp. I am unable to drive especially when there are many lanes as I feel in a fog and can't accurately pick up a lot of scenery. I also cannot go into stores because the scenery makes me lightheaded when theirs a lot going on. I also feel pressure behind my eyes which makes my eyes tired. \n\nMy anxiety has been very high from these symptoms and if I start to panic everything gets worse. I have been having weird anxiety riddled dreams as well as these symptoms have been here 24\/7 for nearly 7 months and no doctor has a clue.  I have gotten MRI, MRA, MRV, CT Scan. I have been to 3 neurologists, 2 ENT, emergency room twice etc and nobody has any information on what this is or how to help.

On top of the personal stress of breaking up and moving during covid, my performance at work has been poor.  Despite repeated attempts to correct bad behaviors with the support of my company and manager, My performance has not improved and I am experiencing nearly daily mental breakdowns and anxiety\/panic attacks.  I am also not able to sleep for more than 3-4 fitful hours a night.  At this stage I strongly believe quitting will be to the benefit of everyone.

        "69":"Hello everyone, I've been having anxiety attacks for a year and a month and most of the attacks were happened in last 3 months. With covid pandemic, we couldn't go outside and a result of this was vitamin D3 deficiency for me. I am 16 years old, male and I'm aware of what my age brings upon me. I fought against myself for almost a year, got the blood results and sat very disappointed. I knew myself very well and I'm not a person who gets affected by emotions so easily. And I didn't have anything can hit me to ground. Just nothing. I knew it was a biological thing but with these circumstances I couldn't get any help. I want to describe myself,my problems and the help I want to have from you.\n\nI'm a very thinking person, have so much opinions, knowledge on many things. I love philosophy and music. These two things are my favourite in my life.  Sadly, I can't even remember myself, thoughts, artists i love, songs i live with, past I had lived and so on. I've been having these compliments since February 2020; can't remember things, can't think about anything, can't concentrate, always feeling tired and the list goes on. Long story short, I kinda have a fog on my brain (I thought about this when i was new to these). I always found a solution for my problems and never disappointed myself but I can't get out of this anymore. I fought back with this 6 times maybe and I don't have any morale to stand up for one more time. I can't express myself anymore; my school, relationships, inner peace is getting effected heavily everyday. I'm losing my abilities, my skills are diminishing, my creativity is fading away. I can't listen to music anymore, can't find a purpose, can't use my time efficiently anymore.\n\nMy Vitamin D3 results are on the floor. The low vitamin limit is 20 mg\/L and mine is 5.4 mg\/L. I started taking 3.000 iu daily supplement for almost 2 months and I am a lot better than before but the psychological consequences are still upon me. I talked with a friend of mine and they said you may have anxiety. I agree with this, my last few months corrupted by it and depression. I am not a depression person and know how to fight against but heavy stress from my school is blocking my way out and I feel hopeless. I'm afraid of losing my thoughts, my mind, my personality, everything I love and care, interest in my hobies. I read that vitamin d is the background of these diseases. Also I'm having sleep problems for months, this is a factor too. Please enlighten me if you know about this and had experiences. Thanks.\n\nI'm sorry if I used english bad, complicated. I'm in a very tough situation while writing this, please understand me, I can't even write things in my mind I'm so sorry about this.",

Our government is highly incompetent, and is led by people who led pogroms against minorities. Their lack of empathy is our there, where our people (not the the poorest ones but especially them) are dying without oxygen. Our government did not plan in one whole year, and now we have no vacant hospital beds, no ICU beds, no ventilators in the national capital and other states. Basics such as oxygen cylinders are a struggle to purchase, and thousands are dying each day, among which a lot of deaths are those that could\u2019ve been avoided.

        "74":"Bit of a rant - just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same (excuse the word vomit, i've been up since 6:30 AM for an exam). It's finals week and anxiety\/stress is at an all time consistent high. On top of that, our family puppy has been great but I think my school anxiety has trickled in to me worrying over him more than I should, and I constantly get overwhelmed with all the things I have to get done. I can't even enjoy food because I am always thinking too much and get caught up in the stress of school. I literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping, and I immediately said \"wow he's depressed isn't he\" when he's just SLEEPING. I went out to get food, totally fine, no problem. As soon as I got home it hit me again with all the stuff I have to do. The pandemic has 1000% affected my mental health especially recently, where I don't get any enjoyment of stuff at home because I am always in front of a damn computer screen. I used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school, and now I see home as the place where I do everything and there's no distinction between relaxing and school. But - the one thing I can hold onto is that it is going to PASS. All of this is going to pass at some point, the brain is just rewiring itself because of the situation happening globally. It's going to be okay, the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. If this spoke to anyone out there, feel free to let me know how you're feeling. How are you coping? \\*\\*And if there's any puppy pros in the crowd, please let me know what you did to help release some of that feeling of wanting constantly to helicopter over them during times of stress. When I feel relieved, I don't feel any need to check on him constantly or obsess over little things around the house, just when I am overwhelmed; and then, I don't get anything productive done anyways. I always remind myself I am not alone - and neither are you. Even talking to strangers about it can be soothing in a way, just a little reminder that there's someone else out there in your boat during such a difficult time. My counselor said to normalize what is normal during an abnormal time period. And also, don't forget to tell your pets you love them.",
        "75":"Hey guys, I've started stuttering basically out of the blue a year ago at 22 years of age... I don't really know the cause of it, It could be drugs, medications I take (Valium and Sulpiride), could also be major traumatic events I've experienced throughout my life..\n\nBasically it started as I know one day when I was out with my mom and my sister. That day I've experienced severe depersonalization and remember when we were talking about something, It was my turn to talk but at the first word of the sentence I startet to repeat the first letter over and over again and just stopped talking.. We were just sitting there silently embarrassed about what had just happened lol..\n\nI do remember a month ago before this event when I was taking speed (amphetamine) I just had a mild stutter at a sentence once a week and didn't think anything of it.. Anyways, from that event with my mom and sister I kind of developed a fear of stuttering and started to research stuttering and it just became worse...It kind of became a habit to stutter as always before speaking to anyone I would think of how not to stutter and of course it worked the opposite as you all know..Most people don't even know I stutter because I hide it pretty well, I would stop before a stutter and kinda pretend I'm thinking or jus say \"umm\" and try to find the right word I would not stutter on.. I've also asked my mom if I've ever stuttered as a child, she said that I didn't.. So I think that developemental stuttering is out of the picture.. and also no one in my family had any kind of speech disorder..\n\nI really don't know what to do with this, I'm constantly stressing myself out.. I've said to myself that I would never go to a speech specialist because I would think about my stutter even more, I just try to forget about it.. and it sometimes works when I'm happy or preoccupied with something that I don't have time to think about my speech.. I'm also scared shittless of going to a neurologist because I'm a bit of a hypochondriac lol.. and the fact that I've started to forget things, words, sometimes I can't understand a sentence and have to read it 10 times to even try to understand it, but it happens very rarely.. All of rhis could be because of the medication or sever stress.. I really don't know.. So basically I'm asking you guys if you ever had a similar experience, or if you know anyone who experienced something like this.. It could also be that I'm so fucked up mentally that I've just imagined my stutter and the fear of it keeps it alive lol",

With this back and forth of restrictions and uncertainties, many people seem to just be so sick of it and have started to ignore the restrictions and hanging out as normal. Working in healthcare, especially as a frontline worker, I have a hard time doing that. I certainly don't want to be the person to be a super spreader since I work at multiple sites. They typically have gatherings that involve drinking and ending up indoors. I feel like such a prude for wanting to follow the guidelines and just have outdoor gatherings so I don't end up going.

        "90":"\n\nAs the Earth rotates daily on its axis, every morning the sun brings light to the darkness, warmth and comfort to the chill of night, photo synthesis to plants, and security to humans. \n\nIt's for this reason that as far back as 14,000 8.C.E., adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cave walls. Countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Mayans and the Aztecs, and the Australian Aborigines, to name just a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source of enlightenment, illumination, and wisdom. \n\nWhile the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on Earth because the Earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields.\n\nOn a grand scale, it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between the sun's energy, the Earth's energy, and the energy of all living species. On a micro level, all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit or vegetable to understand this interdependence. \n\nConsciously absorbing that energy to combine with your own Spiritual Energy has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more.\n\nYour spiritual energy goes under many different names like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pit\u012b, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.\n\nHere's a 3 minute [YouTube video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/uKdiTTbWbIA) expanding more on the benefits and how to, actually absorb the energy from the sun, through your own self-induced voluntary goosebumps from positive events\/thoughts\/memories\/feelings.",

My job is completely stressful. When i'm there i'm constantly looking at my computer screen doing work. If not one thing then 3 different things at once. I don't take breaks outside of lunch. I feel like everyone at my office hates me. They think i'm \"boring\". No. I'm just the only one in the office who doesn't have anyone friends, relationships, or fun outside of the office. I don't have a lot of fun and exciting experiences in life so I literally have nothing to talk about. I\"m judged negatively for this everyday. I beat me self up for this everyday. Its like i'm being jumped by a bunch of bullies and i'm the worst one. Support doesn't exist. I live with people I don't talk to at all. No love. I'm unattractive to everyone. I feel like people are just mannequins waiting to tell me that I need to do more or I haven't done enough....They want me to go out and experience things they don't want to be a part of. It's like if you don't want to be a part of my life then don't \"help\" me. You are a person too. I'm looking at you too. I'm trying to talk to you too. I'm trying to build a relationship with you too. Everyone acts like you. Everyone wants to \"help\" me like you. Everyone wants to push me away like you. None of you are different. That's why I don't talk. No one is different. No one wants to build anything with me. Everyone expects my life to already be built so I can entertain them from a distance. I want love. I want friends. I want a girlfriend. I want to have fun times with people who want to have fun times with me.\n\nLife's not worth living otherwise.",

The survey is expected to take about 5 minutes. It will present certain questions about your visits to greenspaces over the last month and some other questions related to your general stress levels during that period.\u00a0\n\nYour participation will be a valuable addition to our research and findings and could lead to a better understanding of the impact of green spaces on mental health.\u00a0\n\nHere's the link to the survey: [https:\/\/derby.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV\\_bwLW75hjb7zDh1I](https:\/\/derby.qualtrics.com\/jfe\/form\/SV_bwLW75hjb7zDh1I)",

        "120":"I have immersed myself into my career at the company I have been working with for 5 years this March. I am in my mid 20's and in a position that everyone said I couldn't do when I was promoted. The first 3 months were rough, but I learned from my mistakes and got comfortable and do my job well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first year and a half in management I was always stressed, but I was not as overwhelmed as I am now, and I seemed to enjoy myself outside of work more. I got to a point around the 2 year mark in management where I was super comfortable where I was and was working regular hours (45 hours a week or so). When Coronavirus hit, it was like our workflow increased, with less people to work, and more demand on us as managers.\n\nI went through one of the hardest summers working with minimal help, doing more projects then ever. Follow this by Hurricane Sally, worked 60+ hours for a few weeks, customers constantly not being understanding of the situation and only making me feel like I was failing them, to no fault of my own. \n\nThe next few months my workload seemed to grow exponentially, but I was unable to focus and keep up with where I know I need to be. I eventually go to the doctor and test for ADHD and get prescribed Adderall. ( I should add I was already taking Adderall at times for a month or two prior because I could not focus at work whatsoever). \n\nThe Adderall helped me more then I could've hoped, I was now as high functioning as I used to be and was knocking work out. It has leveled out some now and I feel normal on it now but still get positive results out of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am in the same boat as last spring, 40% of employees I need to keep up with workflow, certain material is hard to come by or non existent, constant weather issues, and customers just keep approving work. \n\nI am working almost always 7 days a week. I'm up by 445 and wont get home until 5 or 6 on average but I have a few days every week  I work till 7 or 8 to finish a job or get material. I now even spent my money to setup an office at home so I could work in my free time just to try and catch up. We are working skeleton crews, and seems there is no end in sight to the labor shortage. \n\nA lot of the responsibilities I feel so overwhelmed and stressed by are ones I have taken on myself, because no one else was. I have an ownership mentality and treat this business as it was my own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that's the work part of it....\n\nI had an almost 5 year relationship with the girl I was in love with, that ended in me heartbroken and afraid to trust any one. I kept to myself but talked to a few women here and there. I found one, that I had any real connection with, and that ended as a failed relationship. I fell more in love with this woman then I ever felt with my previous girlfriend, and was in a dark place when she left. Follow this by months of me feeling like I wasn't enough and no one I wanted, wanted me. \n\nI have a handful of good friends, and a couple that are one of a kind. But I always feel like I am bothering them, or just there to be there but I know this is me overthinking and all that. \n\nI also rented a house with my \"best friend\" that has turned into a nightmare. Can't say anything without him getting defensive, no help around the yard or house, constantly taking advantage of me being nice. He was also working with me and turned into a BUM and was missing work constantly and always so negative to be around. So add all that stress at work and come home to a house you hate the other person there and have to dread being home until he moves out. \n\nThe past two months have been the hardest I've ever dealt with mentally and physically. \n\nI'm working 10-12 hours a day and coming home and putting proposals or schedules together. I feel like I cant take a day off, much less a whole weekend. Its like we are batting against the odds and something goes wrong every week. But we are also doing great and revenue out the wazoo. All while working salary and not being compensated for the overtime. \n\nI FEEL LIKE IM ABOUT TO EXPLODE. \n\nEvery day I feel like I'm about to have a meltdown and crash mentally. My mental health seems to have  its days. Some are great, some are just days, and some days I just want to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can I cope with all this stress that I take on myself and cant leave \"AT WORK\".",

Everything on planet Earth emits a different frequency. A frequency is also called a vibration. It's also called Energy. It is quantifiable and it is measurable. Every atom emits a frequency. Your DNA at the lowest level emits a unique frequency.\n\nSo your brain is a receiver and a transmitter a frequency. That's the first concept and the second concept is the Law of attraction. Which says, whatever frequency you emit, That exact same frequency is drawn to you. There will be a magnetic pull.\n\nAnd this is a scriptural principle. For those of you who are Christians, Jewish, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists. All these books teach very similar Concepts. What you sow, also you reap. \n\nWhen you put out a frequency the Law of attraction says it must come back. Law of Attraction says by magnetic pull that has to bring that exact same frequency back. Which is based on whatever vibration you put out Whatever frequency that your brain, emotions, body and electromagnetic field puts out. It will attract and it will defy any physical law.\n\nSelf-induced goosebumps, from positive stimulis, allows you to take 100% control of your transmitter by vibrating different parts of your body, and is also able to, as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot) vibrate your whole physical body. \n\nWhen doing so, you consciously activate your physical and spiritual body to attract whatever intention, narrative, thought and emotions that are present when\nconsciously summoning your self-induced goosebumps.\n\nGoosebumps is just the physical reaction, but underneath it, theres a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as Energy.\n\nI've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pit\u012b, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.\n\nIf you would like to know how to activate at will, fully control your Spiritual Chills and how its an important ingredient to the law of attraction, Here's a five minute video explaining just that.
