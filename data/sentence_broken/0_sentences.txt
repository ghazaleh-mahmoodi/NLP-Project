we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.
it usually works out quite differently here than when you say "pm me anytime" in a casual social context.
we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.
we're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.
our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.
it will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.
*****

###summary###

**anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (i.e.
pms, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.
either way, it's unwise to trust them.
** 


"pm me anytime" seems like a kind and generous offer.
and it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.
here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.
* **by posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the op.
if your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.
** [the 1-9-90 rule]( applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.
* people who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need.
**unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.
** this is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.
it's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.
analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.
even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.
it's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue.
* **if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a pm conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/suicidewatch moderators to help**.
(contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police pms.)
* in our observation over many years, the people who say "pm me" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support.
we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.
community input mitigates these limitations.
**there's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.
if helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.
*  we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.
these people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims.
there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues.
**if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.
** this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.
* if ops want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option.
although we don't recommend it, we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support.
if you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them.
welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing.
if you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the "role model" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.
we try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform.
the community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under "community info" in the official mobile apps.
if you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.
********

**please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.
advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.
**  

it's not that we're against activism.
we're strongly in favour of it.
but we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.
thanks for understanding.
*please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.
*

*****

**despite the fact that we always maintain a sticky post about it, we're still seeing a lot of violations of the private contact policy.
please read /r/depression/wiki/private_contact and report any violations that you see.
**  widespread disregard of this important rule causes trouble for both helpers and vulnerable ops, wastes our time, and delays the improvements we're making to the community resources.
i’m still failing but it’s better then not doing anything so i’m still proud of myself
i'm so low rn i can't even type anything coherent..i just want to express i'm at one of my lowest points so that i don't do stupid things.
thanks for listening..

edit: thank you to each and every one of you who took a few seconds or even minutes to remind me that i matter... that even though those "close to me" feel far.. those farthest from me can feel so close❤️ you're a reminder that there's still good in this world and i appreciate all of you.
we'll all be here together, one day at a time x

i was at school yesterday and started having a panic attack because i was remember what bas did to me and sometimes it feels like i can feel it happening all over again.
i wasn't really able to handle it so i decided to go to the counselors office.
it took me a while but eventually i was able to tell them i was sexually assaulted.
it was really hard to get the words to form in my mouth, it felt wrong but i managed.
i knew they'd tell my parents and the police.
i talked to an officer at my school and told him a bit about it, i refused to say what exactly happened and i also refused to give them their names.
they called my mom and told her, i really just felt numb the whole time.
i have to go to an interview with some other police officer, they want me to tell them what exactly happened but i dont know that i can..
my mom told my grandma when i got home and i didn't feel anything.
i didn't say it so it wasn't that bad.
i can see how they look at me differently, the sorrow in their eyes.
if i focus on it it hurts so i just tried to avoid eye contact.
i don't know, it won't leave my head even more than usual.
i feel awful and distant.
i dont know.
i figured people would want an update so yea, here you go.
any advice or anything would be appreciated.
thank you for reading this far and i hope you have a nice rest of you day/evening
i am a college student and i failed all my classes due to the worst depression i ever experienced in my life.
i wasted my parents money and i just want to fucking die.
i hope i die in my sleep tonight.
i’m worthless and a stupid dumbass and everything would be better if i die.
so i found a method of escaping anxiety .
i don't know if it's healthy or not but i started sleeping 12-15 hrs a day.
it's better to sleep than to think about the problems i guess.
i noticed frequently when i watch videos that involve death that people always mention that death was that persons destiny.
for instance i watch spiritual videos sometimes and they will say a spirit communicated that the timing was right.
directly after they say “except for cases of suicide”.
sorry but that makes no sense.
if you have an urge to go driving and accidentally get in a car crash and die how is that different from the urge to go driving and crash because you purposely wanted to end your life?
i personally don’t think it makes any sense that suicide death would be any different from anything else.
i’m just a religious person trying to understand why things happen and i don’t see why suicide would be someone abandoning their destiny.
if everyone has a set path , then they won’t leave that path.
just a random thought i just had, really.
i probably have depression, and i really really hate myself.
but i also find myself fantasizing about having a girlfriend more and more, like, i'm starting to actively want to be in a relationship.
but the thing is, i also tried to follow the rule of " loving yourself before you try to love someone else " for a long time.
and yeah, how could i actually love someone if i don't like myself ?
i don't know.
it's like i am not even sure what it is i truly want.
do i :
a : actually want someone to love 
or b : do i just want to stop feeling lonely ?
do i just want to use a person to fill a void in my life ?
as much as i would love to believe it's the first option, the truth is it's probably the second one.
and it makes me feel like such a scumbag, wanting to use people.
and i hate myself even more.
but even if i know all this, at the end of the day, the desire of wanting a girlfriend is still here.
so yeah.
it's a vicious circle.
to some extent, it even applies to my friends, are my feelings of love and admiration for them genuine ?
or do i just like the fact that being with them is the only thing that makes me happy ?
how can you be so fucked up you don't even know how you, yourself feel about things anymore ?
it’s hard to believe that i’ll ever be happy in the way that others around me seem to be.
i don’t really feel like i belong anywhere, with anyone, and i feel like i just bring misery along with me wherever i go.
i’ve felt sad for as long as i can remember and there was a lot of problems at home when i was younger which probably didn’t help.
i don’t like feeling like this and i wish it would go away.
sometimes feels like i’m detached from the rest of the world and i’m just looking in at it from a glass window.
posting this here cause i don’t have people to talk to about this stuff and also cause i just want to find some comfort knowing that someone out there can probably relate.
really is unfortunate :// oh well.
i'm back in therapy and ready to open up about my past.
i'm so tired of waking up tired every day.
i'm tired of being miserable and depressed.
there has to be more to life than this.
we all deserve better.
today marks the day that i have brushed my teeth every day for a week.
it's not much, but it feels like i'm at least in control of something
yeah i’m all set.
i dont like life.
i absolutely hate waking up.
the second my alarm goes off i start crying most days.
then i get up, go to work, come home and make dinner etc but like why?
for what?
cus people dont want me to go??
cus it’ll be sad?
tough nuggets.
i’m fucking done.
sorry mom.
the thought of 50 more years of this shit is mortally terrifying.
i’ve been managing alright but today everything came back around to haunt me.
all the of feelings of self hatred and low self esteem because of trauma, the pain of isolation and not having anybody to lean on or vent to.
i just want to be heard for once and i want to know that i’m not crazy for feeling this way.
i let out some tears which i haven’t been able to in months since i’m so numb.
i’m tired of feeling so terrible
na ill be alone and a virgin forever.
depressed and miserable forever.
low sex drive forever.
useless forever.
ugly forever.
what a fucking painful existence fuck hahahaha life is a troll nothing else fellas
when i'm drunk i'm so much more energetic, happy and sexual active.
i have myself for this thought.
i feel like an odd ball.
it's known that depression usually kills your sex drive, but it's the complete opposite for me.
i have severe depression, but i'm horny all the time.
is it only me?
?
long, dramatic read about my life ahead of you.
also wrote this on mobile so sorry for the format and mistakes 

note: i posted this on r/suicidewatch just now as well, and figured that this would probably be a community that would resonate with some of what i said here too.
i'm tired of living my life.
i feel like i've tried so many different times to change who i am.
to catch up.
to be a person who can speak coherently.
to be a person who can be interested in things and put effort into them.
to be a person who takes care of themselves.
to be a person at all really.
haven't gotten anywhere in what feels years.
for context, i used to be pretty happy and on a good track when i was really young (4-10 years old).
i had good friends, did well in school etc, but then i had to be fucking stupid and prioritize video games/internet over everything else.
i started pretending i was sick and did everything i could during 5th grade to stay home and be on my computer, and for some reason, be it anxiety or charitablility/empathy, my mom played into it and let me do it.
eventually, it got out of control and there was a period where i got pneumonia and lobbied my parents to let me stay home for weeks which put me in a shitty position with the school i was going to.
but that's okay!
my mom has a solution.
online homeschool.
i think online homeschool can be done well and i don't think my mom was malicious.
i truly and honestly think she wanted the best for me, but fuck me this was this not the way to go.
i stayed at home every day all year round while, submerged my self in all sorts of media and, on a more positive note, did good with the little amount of school work i had to do.
but most importantly i isolated myself in my room, and didn't talk to anyone for large periods of times, not even people online.
i feel like this messed with my psyche a lot.
i mean, imagine next to no experiences (in the form of personal ones, not learned ones) from the ages of 11-14. maybe i'm making a bigger deal out of it than it is, but either way, that period of my life has shaped me into the absolutely worthless fucking human being i am now.
i've tried going back to school in person multiple times in middle school, and now highschool, and it's not worked out too well.
i just can't effectively communicate ideas talking to people, and i struggle a lot with figuring out what people mean in writing and when they're speaking to me.
i'm overall really stupid and lazy because of the lack of challenge i've had throughout my entire, even before i went to online homeschool, but i've gotten really good at gaming academics and speak in stilted language so a lot of people at my school and my age in general think i'm smart, in that sort of stereotypically autistic way.
it's cringe, i'm cringe and so many of my interactions as result are very awkward.
i genuinely hate myself too, i mean really hate myself, and it's done me 0 favors since now i have a much more negative identity which makes me want to be a edgelord.
and usually i temper myself, but it's become much more difficult in the past year due to being right back in the same situation i was before in online school with covid and all, and of course that's caused my mental health to decline drastically.
leading me to the present actually.
if you haven't noticed too, there are a lot of details i've been leaving out and gaps in my recantation, and it's due to a lot of factors, but primarily depression and ???????.
i have this sort of bizarre pesudo-state way of describing what happens in my mind, and it makes formulating what i feel into words fairly difficult, since if i stated it the way i usually think about it would soubd very strange and like i was talking about some sort of fantasy government, which it is.
the other major reason is because my memory and ability to recall events has been damaged by depression and anxiety, which i've struggled with for years along all the other bullshit i've managed to do to myself.
point of all this being that this might all seem strange.
(i'm not autistic by the way).
anyway on to the part that makes this post appropriate for the subreddit.
i'm 16 years old right now, and i'm going to kill myself tonight because i'm tired of the things i put myself through, and my repeated inability to deal with them.
my parents are going away, and i have everything i need to pass peacefully and cleanly.
i love my parents, but i don't want them to see me when i eventually become the deadbeat dipshit that i feel like i'm doomed to become if i keep living.
i'm sorry for what they'll go through and i'm sorry for everyone i'll hurt.
but this cannot go on anymore.
i'll be here for a few hours after i post this, and then i'm attempting.
you guys are strong, all of you, even if you don't think you are.
no matter how much this disease beats you down and strips you clean, you somehow get back up and struggle onwards.
is it for the people you love?
the future that might be filled with bright skies?
the simple concept that you can get better here and now?
i'm fearing that my time's up once again.
i've just found myself sliding back into terrible levels of apathy and agony, finding it harder to enjoy the simple things in life and near impossible to attend classes or take basic care for myself.
i don't have the strength to kill myself or the strength to heal and move on; so here i am, just waiting and rotting.
i dream sometimes, that i have a way out of this mess and can make my way in life.
sometimes i'm able to dip my toes in the water, feel it's not as cold as i thought, but it doesn't take long for me to remove them again.
music and sleep are my two only escapes now, minus here.
it just feels like i'm in purgatory, not dead but not alive either, just waiting to pass on.
with how fucked my mental state is, it's not hard to think i never belonged here at all.
maybe to make some people happy but... dear god, nobody deserves to suffer like this.
just before i die i want these few seconds of peace.
i would trade my entire future for that.
idk why buy i just took my exacto knife and sliced my palm, when i went to the sink the clean it up and stuff someone stopped and asked if i wanted a bandage or something and took me to get his first aid kit and fixed it up, but while he was doing so he asked me why i did it, and if it felt good or anything and i just didn't know what to say, i didn't think he'd know i did it to myself on purpose.
idk why i'm typing this just felt like saying it somewhere
it should be enjoyable, right?
games, at least.
and of course i know it won't be all the time, there will always rainy days.
but it feels like every rain is a flood sometimes.
i just want to have fun doing the things i want to.
sure, i could try yoga.
or running.
but i really don't want to--they don't interest me.
i am trying other hobbies that do, but still...do i just have to dump any hobby that frustrates me?
i've tried to ask for help online.
i guess i am again, now.
the advice always feels the same though.
put in 100+ hours and it will click; try something else; take a break; drink more water.
yeah.
so, only after hours of frustration, do i deserve to have fun?
this is mainly a rant.
i wrote in my journal and have a therapy appointment tomorrow; i just needed to try and get this to someone tonight.
it's actually stupid that i'm not dead yet.
life has had it out for me since i was born.
just everything is always getting me down.
living fucking hurts.
i've written countless suicide notes only to rip them up and throw them away cause somehow i can't bring myself to go through with it.
i don't have anything to live for.
not sure if i ever did.
i have so many mental health problems to boot.
i have trouble communicating with people so i can't even ask for help.
i'm just tired.
tired of being myself.
tired of being alive.
tired of hurting.
do y’all ever feel like you’re circling the drain?
like every time you think things are getting better they’re suddenly worse again?
my biggest stressor and what gets me down the most is my financial situation.
i kill my self working 60-70 hours a week at a thankless job that i moderately enjoy most of the time (except when i’m stuck with certain coworkers) and i feel like i’m always struggling financially.
i feel like i’m stuck in this loop, i finally get caught up and then something bad happens and then i’m back to square one.
then i can’t help feeling guilty i screwed up and then i’m too depressed to make it to work, or my depression results in bad choices that only make the situation worse (like eating my feelings).
i just feel like i can’t catch a break lately.
my depression, anxiety, and ocd are truly out of control and i don’t know what to do.
let’s not even discuss the fact that doctors and everyone are doing phone consultations only and talking on the phone gives me big anxiety.
i feel so.... trapped.
more than anything i wish i had someone to lean on or at least talk to.
most people i know don’t care, don’t understand, or my own pride/ego keeps me from saying anything.
i don’t want to let people know i’m broken, but i’m so broken.
😞
this has become a daily thing now.
im genuinely at rock bottom in my life rn, be it personally or professionally or health wise.
i see no hope or absolutely no vision for my future.
i've given up now.
im genuinely just going by the flow.
my only escape now is overeating.
just gorging in food.
every night i overeat shit tons of junk, have gained so much weight coz of it, and sleep around 6am everyday.
makes me feel awesome yea?
im so done.
always been so lonely nd worthless.
i just want to be set free from this world, i want to be free...
i guess i have always been depressed but never really thought much of it.
i'm now 30 and i'm all of a sudden cognizant of all my failures.
looking back i have never really lived a day in my life.
never had any friends due to severe social anxiety, probably on the autism spectrum, never formally diagnosed.
never been in any relationships, hell, haven't had any sort of intimate contact with the opposite sex.
never travelled, never had any sort of a social life; spent all of my time holed up in my room and never made any efforts to improve myself.
skipped school a lot in my teens and had to be held back an extra year but by some miracle was able to go onto university which i somehow graduated from.
fat good that did me other than getting me into massive debt since i barely make above minimum wage at my job which took me over a year to land.
i can't even drive at this age and still live with my elderly parents who i depend on for everything.
i haven't left my room for over a year now since my job is fully wfh due to covid.
don't have any reason to leave the house anyways since i have no one.
i see no purpose in life other than repaying my parents for everything they did for me but i screwed up even that.
i was retarded enough to stake their retirement savings and lose more than half of it last year.
i want to try to get better but i just don't have the energy or motivation to even try.
what is even the point when at 30 i have 0 life experiences.
almost everything i do feels like a chore, i can do one thing but then i’m reminded of all the other things that i need to do.
just getting up early or showering at night.
trying to get my drivers license, applying to jobs, uni work, family, exercise, booking appointments.
then have to shower and keep up a skincare routine.
other people just do things... because thats what we do, were human so we make things happen.
i seem to be broken in that way.
for once i want to hear it’s okay to let go from my loved ones.
i’m tired of life and realizing life is all about what and who you know is exhausting.
i don’t want to better myself, i don’t want to get worse, i just want to give up.
i almost hate depression sometimes because i’m told it’s depression making me hate life but in reality it’s me.. i can look at myself logically and think hey this isn’t for me.
it’s just not enough bang for the buck.
i feel like it’s taboo to question the value of your own life but when big business does it, it’s acceptable?
i want to sleep forever , that’s the existence i want.
in my dreams where no one can hurt me.
i get no sense of satisfaction or happiness from anything.
everything is emotionally and physically draining and unappealing.
i feel lonely and like an outsider no matter who i spend time with or how much time i am around other people.
i truly feel like a husk, an empty shell of a person.
i will experience short bursts of energy that resemble hypomania more than actual joy and happiness.
i look forward to nothing and every day is just a repeat of the past.
i just got out of the hospital less than a month ago and i am afraid that i will attempt again soon.
i dont know what to do.
i have tried thirteen different medications.
i am sick and the sickness will not leave me.
i dont know why i am posting this.
i am sorry
i use to be really depressed about a year ago.
things have been ok since then.
i do not feel depressed anymore but everything still feels blank.
like there is no point for me to live.
i have noticed that ever since i was depressed, i started to lose empathy.
i considered myself to be a very empathetic person back then and now i don’t really care about others.
i don’t care if people think i’m an asshole.
i am doing so horribly in school right now.
i don’t know why or what to do about it.
i guess i know some things, but i feel powerless over my behavior.
i don’t know how to force myself to change.
i have horrible time management skills, and i just have such a hard time focusing or getting myself to do anything.
some context: i’m in college so i feel even more hopeless because of how much money it costs.
i am mostly isolated in my room all day and i don’t have much of a social life.
i used to care about things.
when i cared, everything felt like it came naturally to me.
i feel so powerless over my own life that i don’t want to live or die, i just don’t have the energy to exist.
i don’t know if this makes sense...has anyone gone through something similar?
i just feel so lost
where should someone go?
most places just seem like inevitable disappointment.
i’m open to new experiences, but i don’t want to do them alone.
 don't really know where to begin even if i keep trying to so here is this word vomit: i've lost all appreciation for my studies since covid hit.
that had been my acnhor since the beggining and i was doing well, but now i can't even complete a single assigment and they keep pilling up.
i have almost failed out twice simply for not doing my assignments and i don't know how to continue.
i also lost my job recently.
plus, everyday is a struggle and i have to find ways to distract myself in order to simply be sane.
i can't really express myself very well when other people ask if i'm okay, although i say yes always i'm secretly rotting inside.
sometimes i simply wish to walk away from it all, to dissapear from friends and families and lose myself in a part of the world i don't really understand.
however, i'm pretty sure i would end up perishing in the first few weeks, but that doesn't seem to bad.
i don't know if i like life anymore, everything good just sort of dissapears or fades away with time.
even activities i used to enjoy are slowly losing their touch.
eventually, i'll have nothing left.
how the hell am i suppose to be an adult when i can't even figure out how to life until tommorow.
hell, i can't even do shit without drinking a few beers to simply numb my ever anxious mind into oblivion.
i don't want to push people away, but just look at this.
no one deserves to read this, to feel like this or to try and deal with someone like this.
i cant feel like i used to feel.
its all so numb and watered down as shit.
music is not the same for me.
i have trouble thinking of what to draw.
and when i do, im too depressed to put in effor into my drawing.
and i end up just scribbling cause i cant draw.
its affected my thinking.
i cant think cause i dont want to.
i dont want nothing.
but i care what people think of me.
one moment iwant friends, but then the next moment i hate people.
and then im grumpy sometimes too.
i cant even organize this stupid post.
my brain is too lazy to organize this directionless post.
i just want to feel good.
feel proud.
feel apreceated for my art.
i just want to finish a fucking song.
i have over a thousand random recordings of song ideas but im to depressed to finish any of them.
im always fucking tired.
i just want to sleep for ever.
cause sleep is the only peace i get.
i always feel horrible and miserable when im not asleep.
even now i feel misserable and horrible and dissapointed in mys3lf.
i can cry if i wanted to right now.
i want happyness.
love.
apreceation.
i want to feeel gooooooood.
goood gpooooood gooood ggooooood i want goood.
happpy.
happy happpppy.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah pc c co if k if mbp c
at least this motivates me to be more independent.
me 22, not productive, has no motivation, no money to go to a psychiatrist also i look at other people my age how good they're doing in terms of relationships, university, work, and so on, and this brings me down also i can't get out of my comfort zone, and maybe this is the one reason why i feel down and starting to feel i'm beginning to be depressed.
and now i'm here thinking all the bad things that can happen to me, being down all the time, thinking that there's no point in even trying to make things better, but from time to time i try to change this just like now.
i'm in love with the girlfriend of my best friend and this is the one thing that brings me down **(because it shows what a bad friend i am, but that's another topic, i just felt like telling you this)** so i tried to distance myself from this group of friends, to see if i'll curb my feelings towards her.
so i guess i'm searching for your help.
i know it's going to be easier to search on the web "how not to be depressed" or "how to be motivated" and all this kind of bs, but i think that i would nicer and more helpful if an actual human told me how to act at this point in time of my life.
hopefully, this gets your attention.
and huge respect for the people that are helping others!
best regards, kosti
i just want to ask, is 2021 the worst year so far for anybody else?
i just begged my bf not to talk to any girls while he’s out at a bar because i’m so insecure that i think he would want to cheat on me to get away from me.
i feel so embarrassed because he’s not a cheater and is a good guy i’m just afraid that he’ll eventually see me the way i see myself.
everyday i get up i just feel null to my life.i feel like i’m trying to fix a broken puzzle but every time i get to the last piece it falls apart.i can go out and feel somewhat happy but when i get home i just feel sad.
i wake up and i’m sad.
my life is so repetitive and it feels like when i think i can get ahead i end up further in the hole.
i am only seventeen and i’m already genuinely depressed.
i feel like a relationship would help me but every-time i reach out i get treated like i don’t matter or don’t exist.it feels very defeating each day to try and make myself happy when i’m not.
i don’t even care about the abuse i suffered as a child, it’s been half a decade and i still can’t forgive myself for how i treated my ex girlfriend.
i may kill myself one these days, i thought moving across the country would help but it didn’t, i can’t escape these regrets.
i’m starting to realize this won’t ever go away and things only get worse over time.
i know i can’t be helped either.
why can’t nobody see that i’m struggling, i’ve said i’ve had suicidal thoughts, i’ve mentioned the nightmares, my co workers can see it and but not my own family.
planning my suicide and it may take awhile but it will happen just have to make some videos to hopefully ease the pain of others.
i don't know when but i know everyday just gets harder and harder

i'm posting here because i'm bored, don't know what to do i'm unemployed  so everyday is the same, every fucking day, i'm in a bad mode right now, i'm not sad i just feel like an emptiness inside me its terrible i hate so much about life being fucking unfair.
i cant feel anything anymore.
nothing feels good.
i have no purpose.
school is crap, there's no learning.
i miss learning so much.
i miss assignments.
i miss hanging out with friends.
i miss that so much.
i miss wanting to go to school.
i don't know what to do.
i constantly have these thoughts in my head, yelling "kill yourself," over and over again.
i'm stuck in an awful limbo.
everything feels so surreal.
sometimes ill feel so disconnected and distorted from reality, it'll all feel so strange.
i miss feelings.
so much.
help
i'm so tired of being alone
i've been going to therapy on and off for years now but i think i've gotten out of it everything i can get.
my problem is emotional, but therapy can't change emotions.
it only changes behavior.
at my core i'm a used up former gifted kid haunted by they days when i used to feel the rush of ideas and passions through my head, and what i want more than anything else is to feel that sensation again.
but i can't.
i don't know how to get back what i lost, and it's becoming abundantly clear that nobody – not me, not my therapist, not anyone i've talked to on the internet – has any idea how to do this or even if its possible.
i invest my trust in a therapist because i know i can't rely on myself, but ultimately investing that trust in someone else is equally unhealthy.
it means i convince myself that they have answers when they don't, and because i fail to get the answers i'm looking for i get frustrated at the world, lash out at the people i think are withholding happiness from me, when the simple fact is there's no happiness to be had

i can't make myself happier, but i'm sure as hell making myself more miserable by continuing
i’m here to talk to anyone who wants to.
why do i exist?
i've been asking myself this a lot lately and i can't think of an answer.
i looked a little into some different believes for an answer but i don't know what to think.
everyone that believes in god(s) says that we have to please them or we will live in eternal suffering, the big bang says that we were a mistake, and buddhism says that existence is nothing but eternal suffering.
all of these suck.
for a while i thought that there was never a beginning but if that were true than where's my purpose?
why do i exist?
is it just to suffer?
is it to extend the life of my species by another generation?
is it to make a difference?
do i exist for no reason?
am i an accident?
what am i?
who am i?
being nobody is really getting to me now i thought it was something i could ignore n being nobody means who are u n idk who the fuck i am anymore i'm lost now n its fucking hard trying to keep this last bit of me here n every time i look in the mirror i know who he was but at the same thing idk him
i've already accepted the facts that imma kill myself, im not scared of death suicide at this point it's my only salvation im just glad i have it all planned out i know i have to do one last thing before i end my pathetic life and unfortunately it's gunna take time till then ill be fantasizing about being 6 feet below.
i know saying this makes me sounds selfish and at this point i can care less, somebody once told me to think about my family but to me there's nothing to think about they won't know and if they do find out which i'm sure they will im sure they'll be fine i was nothing but a burden to them 21 years spent so unsuccessfully what a waste of a human being mark my words when i say that i will kill my self this isn't a threat its a fucking promise
fucking hate myself.
feel like i fucked up, i always find a way to fuck up.
there's no hope for me.
what's worse i shouldn't be this miserable.
i should find a way to get my shit together but i never get a grip.
i'm lost, how do i stop hating myself?
everything i do is cringe.
it's everyday shit.
the guilt the shame and the regret is unbearable, how do i manage?
i want to disappear, i want to give my life to someone who deserves the things i have.
i should be happy!
i have everything one could ask for, yet i still feel like shit.
how do i stop feeling like shit?
i've realised i've become so accustomed to my depressed state that i've essentially forgotten whta having a normal functional life is like.
i just don't understand how people wake up early, eat properly be productive then sleep.
i can't do anything properly.
can barely get myself out of bed in the morning, barely get any sunlight.
barely eat anything to the point where i'm now ridiculously underweight.
but at the same time, despite this all contributing to low self esteem, social anxiety and depression, i still can't find the motivation to change.
recently jobless, depressed, and just don't know what to do with my life.
lost my purpose, and not sure what i'm supposed to do.
i hope it gets better :(
i was always suffering from my mental health and i was always very harsh and neglectful with myself but the last six months i tortured and punished myself on a whole new level.
in november my country entered in strict lockdown again and since then i stopped exist as a person.
i don't if this was a manic episode or something else i know that nobody could possibly suffers more than me.
i wouldn't wish even to my worst enemy to go through such a thing.
the last six months there is not a day i stay home eventhough i wanted so much.
everyday i walk for miles, i sit alone on dirty benches with only company stray dogs, i drink the same coffee which i hate it and then i spent every night until very late in my mom's car.
i have forgotten to eat like a normal person in my house because i eat the same crap food in the car everyday.
i barely bathe myself and i used to wear the same 4 5 clothes everyday.
my glasses have problem and i can't see well, my shoes are scratched, i have multiple problems with my back, sometimes i was sure i would fade out but i don't care.
every night is a living nightmare, i sweat constantly and go to the bathroom at least 30 times because i have irritable bowel and i keep neglect medical help.
i also suspect that i have a rare syndrome due to my extensive use of cortisol but again i don't do anything about it.
i don't know really why i treat myself this way.
i used to think that my ocd is responsible for all of these rituals because everytime i'm afraid that something bad is gonna happen if i don't do certain things but recently as lockdown stopped i was able to stop many of my rituals quite easily.
my family was always kind of dysfunctional but through  r/raisedbynarcissists and some articles i realized how much damaged they did to me and i truly believe that my cruel self punishment comes from here.
i can't believe how many months have passed and i'm still like that.
i didn't understand that  christmas or easter or my birthday have passed because everyday is the same.
i look my  books, my drawings and cry because i want so much to start over again.
i want to clean my room, my clothes, to spent a quiet evening with reading and music.
i want to write something, to sleep and take care of myself.
i want to be healthy again, stop eating crap food and not be obese anymore.
i have lost so many opportunities, some classes i wanted to attend, movies i wanted to watch, things i wanted to buy.
my life never was good but this sick situation is a whole new level.
i feel so tired.
my body hurts but my soul is totally damaged.
every night i spend 2 3 hours in balcony thinking to jumb.
i waste my time scrolling here reading other people's stories who feel proud of themselves over the tiniest achievements and i can't understand why i punish myself when i have prove in the past that i'm capable to handle very difficult situations.
why i have the need from others to tell me how strong i am?
i'm sorry for my rambling i know that nobody is gonna answer me either way, i just want to share my suffering because i don't have anyone to support me.
i can't find a way to start again my life i don't have energy anymore to try and i know that sooner or later i will end up worst.
i don't want to die but i can't find other solution.
i can't stand anymore the pain i feel when i know that my own mother who i used to believe that she loves me and cares about me she still judge me, neglect me and every moment she don't forget to remind me what a burden i'm and how much i tired her.
of course this is not excuse to become violent towards her but i still do it out of anger and i hit myself also many times.
it's such a shame because i really had dreams and ambitions but i'm tired being to nice with people and all i got all these years from everyone is rejection.
how to love yourself when literally everybody whole my life classmates, teachers, therapists, friends, parents, strangers treated me like a garbage and invalidated me?
the only good thing i can do for myself is to get rid of me as soon as possible.
ps.
the last two weeks things changed a lot and i had to adjust my toxic routine because lockdown was over.
i managed to stop some of my compulsions but i still can't find a way to help myself.
i go out with my mom for shopping, to a café etc.
and she pretents like nothing happened all these months.
i walked on the crowed streets and i feel lost, my social anxiety is getting out of control again and i feel suffocated.
i really wonder where this situation will lead me, i was sure that until now i would be dead or would stop this situation.
should i be depress?
i feel so lonely.
im sorry for my poor english and i wrote this without proper planning , i just want to get this out... once again i apologize.
my(18m)... i'm really tired...my life revolves around books... for the past 2 years i've been stuck in a life style where my schedule was wake up - study - go to school - comeback home and study... i've failed a class and i got held back... with the same old environment... i forgot how to live properly... i can't enjoy myself... my family thinks that i'm just seeking for attention... they think if i laughed a little it means that i'm not depressed or anything... they say i'm getting fat because i spend all the time doing nothing... they probably think i'm a good for nothing who'll end up with no jobs or anything in the near future... if i sleep a little they'll say he keeps sleeping the whole day... i wake up everyday at 3:30 am so that i could revise and practice my pastpapers ,( i'm currently in middle of exam atm) everyday and in the end of the day you get really tired and i'll just go to bed and relax a little apparently i'm not allowed of doing this either... i've never been surrounded by friends because i don't like being around people it makes me panic... i'd usually hide myself... i rarely go out... the only good thing i have is anti depressant i have when ever i'm down i'd just get a pill and my mood will be better... now taking 2 isn't making any effect... i feel like how much effort i do its never gonna be rewarded... i'm probably gonna be kicked out of school in 2 months for failing a second time... i'm gonna suicide before anything bad happens to me... i just wish i could have a normal life like most teenagers friends , coolness , maybe a girlfriend but this seems impossible... no one would like to be friend with someone who's emotionally weak , fat and disgusting...
every since i fucked up a year ago with my then girlfriend, everything has gone down hill.
i can't cry myself to sleep or even cry, im too scared for therapy.
i'm too scared to tell my parents, i'm sick of life.
all its been is beating me down.
i'm a disgusting human being, i deserve death and should just be shot dead.
i don't wanna live any longer.
life is a pain, i'm sick of my family, none of my interests interest me anymore, i hate everything.
i just wanna curl up and finally be able to cry, i just wanna be able to feel good i just wanna be able to feel happiness again.
it's been such an on and off mood.
i wanna start cutting or just skip to suicide, i can't take it anymore..for context, i'm 15 year old male, quite reclusive.
whenever i’m not depressed, i’m eating well, working out and shaping up, but when i’m depressed i over eat, do nothing and gain weight.
i never really processed just how long i’ve been in this weird ass limbo hell mindspace until i go into my notes app and see the depressing ass poems and journal entries i wrote from months to literal years ago.
it’s so easy for me to convince myself that i’m just making it all up because i’m an attention whore, but my abysmal grades and absolutely fucked sleep schedule + antidepressants say otherwise.
idk man the days are just blending together at this point, and the pandemic sure ain’t helping.
i applied for community college thinking “meh i’ll be fine” but i’m kinda wishing i went for the gap year instead.
i’m just tired.
so around the end of last month i decided to go on a diet and i’ve already lost about 10 pounds which i’m very proud of myself about that but lately i’ve been feeling so depressed and having a more low self esteem everyday i keep looking at myself in the mirror just wanting it all to go away and for me to hurry up and get skinny then i think about the past if when i had lost weight before was i attractive enough for a guy?
then the doubts of me wrecking my diet cause back then i would use to do it it’s been a whole cycle of emotions and i hate it so much i just want to stop thinking of the past and move forward to new exciting goal cause i know i can do it deep down i’ve done it many times before i just need confidence:(
in two days, it’s my birthday.
as i’m writing this, i’m sobbing.
for the past two days, i’ve cried hard.
i can’t go a week without freaking out about the future.
i feel sick and numb half the time.
i don’t remember the last time i was able to just breathe.
what sucks is i’m not really worrying about myself.
it’s my older brother.
he struggles in school a lot and i’m just so terrified of the future.
my mind is constantly filled with “is he going to be okay” “is he going to go to college” “will he become homeless and poor” and it’s driving me insane.
this has been going on for so long that i don’t remember what it’s like to not feel this way.
i’ve lashed out on my family due to the stress of it all.
i’ve feel like i’m becoming a menace to my own family.
i know how i’m feeling now is stressing my mom and dad out too.
and no matter what they say, i don’t get any better.
i just cry and i hate it.
i feel like there’s no way to help me.
i’m just broken.
honest to god, i’ve tried so so hard to feel myself.
but it’s all temporary distractions.
doomed to feel this way until i see with my own eyes my older brother become a functioning adult.
and i feel like it’s slowly eating away at me.
i just want to stop feeling horrible.
i want everything to just be okay.
i’ve known this for quite some time but i have to remind myself more often than not.
i have no family, no friends, no one to love because heck why lower your standards to be with me?
i’ve been bullied most of my life by my family, ‘friends’.
i’ve always been the punchline of everyone’s joke at the dinner table and at the school canteen.
i was molested by my cousin, punched by my male neighbour, had a heavy dictionary thrown at me.
been choked by my sister, sat on by my other sister.
i’ve been spat on by my mum twice, threatened by my older brothers.
been told many times that i don’t matter, that i’m not normal; no one has ever defended me.
and i really believe them, i really don’t like me.
i hate me.
i ask god why did you make me?
what a waste of a human life, i will gladly give my soul to a miscarried baby or someone’s sweet grandma who passed away.
if i could, i’ll let them live instead of me.
i don’t want to kill myself but i don’t want to exist, i want to fade away.
11th of february 1998 should mean nothing to everybody.
i’m really sorry that you had to read this, as i’m crying but my whole life, i’ve either been neglected or abused.
no one in my family seems to think so, that’s okay why should they even care about a non-person like myself.
(i’m all emotional because my cat is unwell, he’s gone blind and everyone in the house is blaming me)
suggestions?
seriously: why shouldn't i drive into the desert with no water, a 12-pack, and a fistful of pills?
i cried most of the night last night, and this morning i woke up feeling so tired.
i think i will stay in bed all day.
i dont find joy in anything anymore, i cant even study like i did before, its just, why?
its not like it'll change anything anyways, instead it just makes me feel worse

i wish i knew what to do
as soon as my parents are gone i'm gone as well.
fuck them for having me in the first place yet i can't kill myself and make them live with it.
but once they're gone, i'm gone too and i don't have to deal with being a loser failure anymore.
i don't want them to die anytime soon but relief is coming.
eventually.
this is kinda a long story but imma try to keep it short.
basically tho, i'm quickly losing hope and don't see a point.
don't feel like i'm really meant for this world.
&amp;#x200b;

about 6yrs ago, i told myself i would end it in 5 years if i didn't improve my life.
i succeeded.
got rid of social anxiety and normal anxiety, made friends, improved my grade to a 3.9 gpa in uni and am now graduating.
didn't fix the depression and now i just have more stuff to get depressed over.
recently, got rejected from a program that would have me work over seas.
i asked my best friend out a couple months ago, got rejected.
became much better friends after that though.
later, found out she has a thing for an old hs friend that lives out of state, and a vacation we planned together was in large part so she can hook up with this friend.
so, i'm no longer going to do that trip.
i have a lot of other stuff going on, but those are some things i had hope for recently.
this year i gave myself a hard deadline for when i would finally end it, created a plan, everything.
decided to do it after graduation, so a couple weeks from now.
unfortunately tho, my friend convinced me to stick around for a while (i opened up to her about my depression after we started getting really close.
asshole thing to do, i know).
now i can't even connect to that suicidal part of me.
&amp;#x200b;

tldr: planned on ending things, finally gave myself a hard deadline.
so many things i was looking forward to turned out bad.
worst part is my friend convinced me to not kms.
now i just have to live with this shit until i get that feeling back.
no longer see the point.
when i wake up after 8 hours of decent sleep i’m still exhausted.
all day, everyday.
not just “tired”.
exhausted.
“exercise helps!” yeah i’m sure it does but i can’t even get out of bed.
“drink water and eat healthy!” again, i can’t even get out of bed.
i’m guessing the next thing would be “you just have to use self discipline and force yourself to do it!” but...how?
it feels as though i physically can’t.
i am currently experiencing the worst my depression has ever been.
it’s really difficult to say the least.
i’m genuinely surprised i’m still here.
it sounds wrong but i do feel kinda badass that i’ve managed to hold on so far...and so should you.
we survived yesterday, so why not do it again today?
that’s it.
i miss being normal again.
not constantly worrying about my emotions and my mental health.
i’ve become so self-aware and hyper vigilant that i can’t relax anymore.
i just want to simply exist without thinking too much about it.
i really really miss that feeling.
i just wanna live and get out of my head.
friends.
credit.
a home of my own.
a decent job.
a degree actually worth anything.
any skill at my instrument.
a way out of this hell hole town.
i'm a failure and i should just die
like i've given up on the world.
i always joke about the end of humanity but i really hope it happens.
like seriously no matter what negative shit hits them they are always so fucking positive.
i envy them.
but i don't know what they are by themselves.
like they could be faking it and just being depressed like me.
i could never.
i lost my empathy and happiness.
when i speak i hate hearing my voice, it’s ugly and as soon as i open my mouth i can’t control the things i say.
it’s all just word vomit.
at different times my voice changes.
it’s more disgusting than usual.
when i hear my voice being replayed back to me i just want to rip out my throat.
why can’t i just have a normal voice?
and why can’t i control the shit i sayyy!
!
i haven't experienced sadness like this before.
it feels like my heart it gonna burn a hole through my chest.
my bestfriend who i've known for years now parted ways with me.
we dated for a few months then had an on and off thing for a while.
she turned into a completely different person after the first major altercation.
ever since i've felt like i'm the only one trying to keep our relationship intact.
today she apologized for everything and told me that she couldn't stay with me anymore and it hurts so much to think that someone you loved so much could just leave you so easily.
she was my only support and has even saved me from committing suicide a couple of times.
i feel completely empty.
thinking about how life would continue without her makes me want to kill myself properly this time.
i just need someone to vent to right now.
someone who can help me decide what to do after this.
please help.

i've had depression for 4 years, but the last 6 weeks have been the hardest of my life.
it has gotten so much worse recently, i just really don't have the energy to explain why, but if you've taken two minutes to read this little paragraph, thankyou.
here are my two cents about what doesn't do jack shit about depression.
but first let me give you a story about what 'awakened' my demons.
i've tried two types of therapy for my anxiety/depression issues that were severely exacerbated by condition called cpps (chronic pelvic pain syndrome) that i had to endure for 7 months.
it started it 2020. thankfully i am mostly over it.
this condition has no known cure cure, and you can only pray that it goes away on its own.
most ppl become suicidal due to this condition since it affects your life severely.
symptoms that it causes : urinary frequency (every 5mins you get the urge), inability to defecate (anal muscles are spasmed, pooping takes 1 hour and is incomplete,),urinary hesitancy, sexual dysfunction (blood cant flow into the penis due to spasm in pelvic floor), severe pain/burning in urethra/groin/testicles.
i've been to psychotherapy to sort of cope with this since it is recommended but also for the 'old demons' of regular depression - &gt; "nothing provides joy".
since most of you have the kind of depression that doesn't stem from cpps but rather "nothing provides joy" kind i will touch on that.
psychotherapy is bullshit for that kind of depression.
i've tried two types:rebt and psychodynamic.
psychodynamic  : i had sessions 2/3 times a week.
it is quite expensive when you have that kind of frequency.
the psychotherapist interprets what you say and 'guides you' to come up to your own conclusions.
it is pure bullshit, because there is no 'guide' on how to overcome the issues, and at the end of the day the conclusion that you will inevitably come up with is that nothing provides joy which you've already known.
rebt: this type of therapy is supposed to help you by identifying distorted thoughts and correcting them.
this has some merit for ppl who have mild anxiety/depression since mildly depressed ppl have it probably due to distorted thoughts e. g. i am fat and i will forever be ugly and nobody will love me.
however there are no distorted thoughts in severe depression.
you literally just have nothing that provides joy.
you could argue that it is logical error since you haven't tried everything.
however if you tried a bunch of stuff and nothing gives you joy then a clear pattern is formed that indicates that it is very unlikely that 'next new thing' will be any different.
also you could argue that severely depressed person doesn't have the motivation to even try anything so that argument puts the nail on the coffin.
i've also tried ssris.
they are bullshit, they didn't help one tiny bit.
they caused a bunch of side effects and one possibly permanent side effect.
they caused: weight gain and loss of libido.
loss of libido is still present even though i reduced my dose to minimal.
i have zero libido
it is likely that i developed pssd (post ssri sexual dysfunction) - dysfunction that doesn't go away even tho you quit antidepressant and can last indefinitely.
my advice to people who have severe depression is to ask psychiatrist about antidepressants that don't cause loss of libido (wellbutrin), or about maoi these can cause it but it is much more rare (as far as i know) and are much better when it comes to severe depression.do your own research about maoi since i can't vouch about it not causing sexual dysfunction but i think i'm right.
also ketamine/spravato is recommended for treatment resistant depression, and i think it doesn't cause sexual dysfunction.
magic shrooms/psylocibin is new treatment that seems promising for severe depression.
psychotherapy will just be a waste of time and money in my opinion if you suffer from severe depression.
i am fucking angry that i even wasted my fucking money on it.
especially the psychodynamic one that doesn't even have any scientific data showing it is effective.
it is not even in the domain of science since it isn't falsifiable.
i should've done my fucking homework.
hope this helps you and saves you some money.
i'm 24. i've been diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety since i was 16/17, but i think i've had it a lot longer than that.
i know memory loss can be an effect of depression, but mine seems abnormally bad.
i literally cannot remember anything from my childhood.
i can remember a few of my old friends names and the school i went to, but i can't picture them, or anything we did.
i know that certain things happened (what we used to play, my old address, a couple instances of me being bullied etc) but i cannot picture them, or remember them aside from a few general points (the way we used to play fairies, my old street name etc).
even now, i can't remember what i did last year properly, or specific dates of events i know happened in recent years.
i was just wondering how extensive the memory loss can be, because it's making me feel so, i dunno, empty, weird, lost.
any advice would be appreciated greatly.
does anybody else feel this?
like the only point of doing things is to make others happy?
i really like this teacher.
hes such a good person and has helped keep me happy during this school year.
but it's almost summer.
i fucking hate my home life.
i can't exist without someone yelling at me.
i'm always insulted.
i'm insecure, i'm lonely.
and i'm such a good student, too.
one of those "gifted" kids.
i make straight a's, play in orchestra, very athletic.
school is truly the only place i'm happy.
i don't want to go to summer, and i don't want to leave this teacher.
he's too much of a good person and good role model.
i truly hope to one day have as such a good take on life as he.
  

this is probably the first time ever that i opened up my depression to someone else.
it’s probably gonna be really long, so someone might not finish this.
and english is not my first language you see, so there would be a lot of mistake and my choice of words and sentences might be not really good.
i just feel so tired right now.
so i’m from south-east asia and in here, parents’ words are very important and it is just the tradition here.
it is almost impossible to change now for me.
so during covid-19 i come home to live with my parents because i’m 22, don’t have a job, still in college with not very good grade.
i keep trying u know help around the house, housework.
but for all things you do, they will all down fall to just one mistake.
then here come “these day, you are doing nothing.
all you is eat.
not helping around…” much more.
i did tried talk back a few things only to worsen the mood.
i just don’t what to do to please them.
when i was in middle school, my parents have to become worker in south-korea to make money to support family.
during that time, kids grow very slowly.
i didn’t feel much at first.
without knowing, i start to feel distant from everyone.
i start to be by myself more and more.
i can’t focus on my study.
and when i fail one test with was quite important but won’t affect my final grade, it was a hard fall.
i just can’t get up.
in college, it just got worsen.
my memory start failing my choice of subject is completely off.
interior design for one year was a no because it is expensive and not my type of thing to do.
it third now, my mind is now just tired.
i can’t focus.
i should have choose foreign language.
but now i’m scared cause i’m using my parents’ money for college payment.
and it is third year now.
i feel like a complete failure and really afraid to talk to my parents about it.
what to do?
idk why but i’m really scared of getting a job even a part time.
i can hardly breathe when thinking about moving forward to try new things.
and i’m not close to my friend as before as i start to get depression.
i’m gay but i never open up about it.
no one know i am one except for one of my friend but he was really rich and hanging out with him just feel so awkward.
i only had one crush in high school which i confessed him when i’m in college which was failure.
and i haven’t speak to him since.
so i never really been in relationship.
maybe i can find one??
nahhh i’m not a good looking guy, too tall to be a bottom, too skiny ( i have been in the same 48 kg for 5 years now never gain any weight).
gym?
i just don’t have time and feel really embarrassed about going.
i am too afraid to be in a real relationship.
i’m a very boring person.
i’m bored of things really fast even game.
i can’t chat for long.
i start feel bored and run out of topic to talk about really fast which make me afraid of chatting with someone else cause i’m afraid i might upset them.
so this is it.
thank you guys for reading this.
there are a lot more but these are things that are mainly really not in good way right now.
also i’m feel much better while writing this which make me really sleepy.
i did think of suicide a couple time but never get to do it.
thank guys!
!
idk if it happens everywhere, but where i live stray cats and dogs often go to various houses looking for food or shelter.
it's bad enough that they have to wander around in first place, but even when kind people give them food and water, they look over their shoulders ***every 2 fucking seconds*** and jump away at slightest sound.
they're hungry and thirsty for god knows how long but they're ready to give up food from fright of what might happen to them if they stay.
and this shit doesn't make anyone blink a eye when in fact it is absolutely ***heartbreaking***.
if you tell this to someone, you hear "they're animals, they're just like that" or "why do you care?"
or "why are you overthinking?"
how is talking about real problems overthinking?
half of the time, people like them have made me feel bad for opening my mouth even when i was talking real stuff.
the award for making me start questioning basic ***decency and humanity*** goes to them.
👏
i used to be so smart and be an overachiever.
now its hard to do the bare minimum and i dont even want to do the bare minimum.
is this just my depression or have i genuinely lost braincells to other stuff.
job hunting while depressed is the worst.
every rejection letter tears what little of me is left.
my self-esteem cannot take the abuse.
i swear it's getting to the point i think employers hiring and interviewing me can sense my depression in our 30 minutes of conversation.
i'm trying, but the rejection is starting to take a toll.
i have been texting him for a while now, but his suicidal tendancies are surfacing.
i dont know if i should call someone or not i just need help talking to him.
im just some dumb teenager and i don't know how to help him.
i don't want to lose my friend.
took the plunge and saw a psyche a month ago.
on meds for depression/ptsd/anxiety now.
they said less than a month i should see improvement.
yesterday i cut for the first time in ages.
deep enough i probably should have gotten stitches and then had to lie to my wife about it.
when does this change?
does it ever?
can't go on feeling like this...
first of all if you cant read all of this you can just skip the whole thing and go to the last question.
so i go to a private high school but the thing is my depression and anxiety got so bad that its affecting my school and daily life alot.
i havent left my house in 1-2 years (more like i cant even if i wanted to) because i have severe social anxiety that whenever i try to go outside my door i pass out or get extremely dizzy and start hyperventilating.
the thing is because of this i couldnt go and take my exams in school.
i failed from all of them and im probably gonna fail this year because of them too (im trying to get my school works done at least but ill still probably fail).
my dad spends tons of money for my high school and if i do a year over again he will have to pay all that money again which would be really bad.
i also really dont want to change schools unless i really have to.
i definitely mustnt do a year over so the question is, is there a way to save this?
im already trying not to give up on life and end things so im having appointments with a psychologist.
(i started 2 weeks ago and talked with her 2 times.)
i also have exams in 2 weeks and i still probably wont be able to leave my house.
is there a way my psychologist can write a report to my school so that maybe i wont fail this year because of my severe mental health problems?
all my life i have been pushed around, beaten up still i thought that maybe of this was my childhood then maybe i could have a better future cause i believe in karma and i also do believe that 'what goes around, comes around' but after 2018 life because even more worse for me.
i would say after a 3 year rut it is slowly getting better atleast that's what my parents tell me but honestly i don't believe it.
i look at my 'friends' and see how their life turned out, having great friends and respect and i think to myself that i respect people and don't behave badly with them but i still get ignored.
my social life is a mess, i can't concentrate on my studies and i constantly think that i don't matter in this world, like if i go, no one would care and yes i have been suicidal at times due to how my life went down after 2018 to early 2020. i am not that anymore but still.
every moment of my life is negative.
does it still get any better?
i've been struggling so much in the past couple of months, and i feel like there's no way out.
i can't help but feel like things will never change and i should just give up.
the love of my life killed herself, my family hates me, and i'm too broke to see a decent doctor to refill my psych meds that i hate, and i can't afford even if i have the prescription, and i'm afraid to take them because i had a very scary experience with them.
i am so desperate that i set up a go fund me to raise enough money to get the supplies i need to grow a single cannabis plant, so i can have a natural and reliable source of medicine for my insomnia, ptsd panic episodes, depression, and gad, but then i realized that i don't have any social media to share the link on or anyone to help me share the link, so the likelihood of that even working is slim to none.
if anyone here can help me by sharing the link with your friends, on your social media lmk and i will post the link, or if you have any advice on how to deal with panic attacks or insomnia, or even words of encouragement i would highly appreciate it.
i wish you all the best with whatever you're going through.
thank you
i didn’t love or enjoy anything or anyone until i met her and nobody loved me, so i was so happy when i met her, i finally found someone that loved me and made me happy but she didn’t love me enough to stay and now i’m back to being alone and having nothing or nobody, i’m actually more depressed now than i was before i met her, i feel like i wasn’t good enough and i will never be good enough for anyone.

i feel bound by an inevitable state of uncomfortability.
the feeling of an unknown that is eating me up and i can’t stand it.
this feeling is a lot like being forced to sit in the dark when you are deathly afraid of both- it and all that is imagined to lurk among it.
or like being forced to co-exist with the spider you saw in your room because you’ve lost sight of it even though you are physically and mentally itching to leave every second you are stuck there.
for me, that is the feeling of being awake.
i am constantly itching, every second, to escape my body.
my reality.
i can’t sleep.
i can’t eat.
i can’t breathe.
i can’t sit still.
no good movie, walk, talk, or song is able to keep me from feeling that need to escape me.
i am constantly restless with nothing to distract me because the distractions are merely just that.
distractions.
something to keep me occupied for a few seconds or minutes while the uncomfortability peeps over my shoulder, never leaving.
as if we are attached at the hip.
so what do i do when  i can’t sit still, but i can’t do enough to keep me busy?
i can’t be awake but my body won’t let me sleep and nothing i do to keep busy is able to distract me for long enough to feel something other than uncomfortable.
when your memory sucks so much that you apparently made plans with a friend weeks ago and now that friend is pissed at you for forgetting
hey y'all, i don't know what exactly to say because i don't really know why i feel anxious and sad right now.
i mean i am a generally anxious and sad person but i'm on summer break so i'm free and i have like no responsibilities to be weighing me down at the moment.
so i feel like i shouldn't be feeling like this.
obviously feeling like this is never fun and great but at least i usually know why i'm sad.
i guess i just got a wave of anxiety and sadness come over me and now i can't sleep and i don't know what to do.
i definitely need a therapist and i hope to get one through my college soon (definitely by fall, maybe even in summer if i gather the courage to contact the wellness center).
but until then i don't know how to cope.
i usually just ignore it mostly because i don't feel like i have the time to address it with all my homework in the school year, and because i tell myself i'm just sad because of school and that's normal because everyone in my generation (gen z) is at least a little bit depressed because of school, but now i'm feeling the same in summer and i'm realizing life might just be depressing.
i feel like i do have things to look forward to but right now it feels useless.
recently i feel like a lot of the people i'm close to are being exceptionally selfish.
showing up late if at all, not responding to texts &amp; only ever talking about their own lives.
has anyone else noticed this now that the world is starting to open up a bit more?
or is it all in my depressed head?
according to my health app i've been averaging 321 (yes) steps a day in 2021. today i reached 7,000. i know that might not seem like much to some of you but i've been too depressed to exercise or leave my apartment for the past 6 months so it's a big deal to me.
my whole body hurts but fresh air is nice 10/10 will do again.
i do not know why this came to me but i guess i was bored out of my mind.
my sister came up to me and berated me for not having any aspirations or motivation.
i was trying to hold back the tears but deep down, i knew she was right.
waking up for me is challenge in itself, i'm "unhealthy" and have no self esteem.
i'm at the lowest point in my life.
i just smoked one for the first time in over 1 year and man i can say i feel good.
im watching some youtube and eat a mango, it tastes so good!
(:

i´m with you fellow sufferers, sorry to everyone who has a bad time right now
a lot of stress from family, school, social media, and bullying has been weighing me down a lot.
it feels like nobody is really interested in me enough to talk about it because they wouldn't understand.
i have  a sibling who's the favorite of the family.
they constantly get attention and i'm told to stay in my room.
my own mother doesn't even say "i love you" to me and it makes me feel as if she doesn't really care for me as much since i was an only child.
she won't even talk to me unless i have some sort of missing assignment in class that i'm already stressing about, and she makes it worse by constantly yelling at me about it.
i've been getting bullied a lot on social media and at school.
a lot of people told me to just end it and i'll admit i have had thoughts about it, but then i think of some of the people that really care about me and how it could gravely impact their life, so i just get really upset knowing i could ruin someone else's life.
i've been getting less and less sleep everyday to the point where i don't sleep at all.
sometimes i won't even eat because i'm not in the mood for it.
i started taking less care of myself too because i always just think "there's no point in doing it at this point."
a lot of this stress makes me just breakdown and people think i'm "overdramatic" or that i'm just faking it for attention.
i've asked my friends what to do, they always just say "get over it" and "you're fine."
is there anything i can do to at least bring my stress down?
its 1:30 am i (19 male) am alone in my room can’t figure out what to do for my assignment because i am stupid and just can’t figure anything out on my own, i am not respected by anyone not even my family, my amount of love is never reciprocated back to me, i am fat, ugly, never kissed a girl, i am still a virgin, i am never anyone’s first always last, i have a small penis, i am highly insecure, and i will never be able to find that girl i am looking for.
she would be smart, funny, caring, kind, and beautiful, but even if i would get her she would come to her senses and leave me.
i just don’t feel like being alive anymore because i have nothing left to live for or anything to look forward too.
you know i am not even mad anymore, i am just done.
i know nobody will see this or if they do they won’t care but i just needed to say it
deep down i know this, and in realizing this i feel as if my own cup is difficult to fill even before i could pour it onto others
i'm so used to being abused and unloved that being happy makes me uncomfortable.
i can't accept any good treatment, being abused makes me feel at home.
he says it's likely i have a high functioning depression, because i still manage to go to school and work (but struggle internally constantly).
i have an appointment at the doctor on monday to talk about anti-depressants.
i feel grateful and relieved.
i feel like i can do something about it know.
thanks again to those who encouraged me!
i just don’t find it meaningful to live for myself.
i know all the “you only have one life” “you are the only one who’s always gonna be there for yourself”, but like i just don’t like myself and i don’t see a point in living for myself and i don’t feel motivated to do anything for myself like exercising for your own health.
i feel the most when i’m in a relationship where i can make other people happy and support their goals, but when the relationship ends it’s like i lose my entire purpose of living.
because i don’t know how to live for myself.
i only find meaning in living for my lovers.
any advice on how to genuinely love myself and live for myself?
sorry if my grammar sucks, i am a foreigner.
i am almost reaching my 30 and i just can’t find meaning in life.
all i can think about is death nowadays.
my whole family is here so i am not alone.
i am not into dating nor wanting to make new friends.
i have graduated from college, worked in big companies, and had been in a relationship before just like other people.
i don't have any goals in my life.
i was on depression, anxiety, adhd and bipolar medications before but didn't really help me.
i am just so lost.
i keep saying this but i wonder what it would  actually be like.
would money lose its meaning since you could die any time?
would loans not be a thing anymore?
and most importantly, are we headed towards a future where it will be a choice?
had a long history of depression and suicidal ideations.
i’ve been living alone the past 9 months and i’ve never felt more lonely.
i’ve made friends here at school but i only see them during the day and sometimes when we go out at night.
i’ve had a few girls enter and leave my life so whenever they are around i feel fine for the time being.
eventually though they all leave my life when they become disinterested and i go back to a lonely existence of binge watching shows and playing video games.
i’m healthy, i exercise and i’m competent socially but i’m still an introvert at heart.
not a day goes by that i don’t have suicidal ideations.
even when i have a good day where nothing goes wrong, at the end of the day when i’m in bed i just have an empty and hollow feeling in my chest.
having a companion to fall asleep next to is a temporary pick me up but nothing good ever lasts in my life and that only usually happens once a week if i’m lucky or if they have time for me.
i don’t even know what i’m trying to accomplish by posting here, just trying to put my thoughts down somewhere.
i’m just tired of being tired.
why is it so difficult to be happy even when things in my life are going objectively well?
i feel like even 20 years from now i’ll still carry this great sadness with me and it’ll never leave me alone.
i feel lost and alone.
the first thing i think about when i wake up is how much i hate myself.
i hate everything about me but i’m also narcissistic?
i have these periods of extreme lows and above average highs, but with constant self-hatred no matter the situation.
i’ve done some dumb shit and i can’t let it go and it’s ruining me.
i also have extremely vivid dreams from time to time.
sometimes they are just realistic and vivid, but a lot of the times they are extreme nightmares that could happen irl.
i can’t bother my friends and family, and professional help in my country is useless, i tried it and they just wanted to pump me with pills without me going to therapy or anything.
i don’t know what to do.
i’m lost in my own head, sometimes when i wake up, most times actually, i can’t tell if i actually woke up or is it still a dream.
im crumbling, i don’t know what i want, and i’m hurting.
im so damn lost and i just can’t seem to find someone who gets it.
im not expecting a lot from this post, this is actually my first reddit post ever, but i just needed to say these things.
im fighting it, trying to be tough for everyone, but i’m crumbling, i don’t even know who i am anymore, just another asshole with a victim complex.
i’m losing it and i can’t even cry to let it all out, i’ve become just so dead and i don’t know if i’m coming back.
in december 2020, after months of dwindling mental health, i finally got help for depression.
i was later diagnosed with bipolar depression.
with depression a small step forwards feels like a leap, but a small step forwards is you heading somewhere - no matter how long it takes.
the biggest yet tiniest step i took was forgiving myself for being ill.
for having these chemical imbalances in my brain.
for having to go see a doctor on a sunday.
and the rest was history.
half a year later, i am proud to say i can finally live with myself.
hello, i'm a normal 18 year old boy who is in a misunderstanding.
in short, i have been suffering for the last 1 year, i can feel almost nothing.
i can not love anyone or anything, but before i remember how good it felt to love something and get pleasure from it.
today nothing gives me the same feeling anymore  can not love anyone, although i am sure otherwise   i would have fallen in love with that person.
when i listen to my favorite music i can not feel anything, when i do something that used to give me pleasure ,today it doesn't have any value.
everything is routine and academic, but i am a completely different person.
if anyone can give advice i will gladly listen.
let me just say my relationship with my father went downhill when i was about 8.  he was having problems with his own parents and that created problems within our relationship.
i was a daddy's girl before then.
the actual 'verbal abuse' started in the beginning of the 7th grade.
i'd turned 13 and started wearing black band tees and chopped my hair at about shoulder length (parents thought it was too short but were ok with it for the time being) anyways, the first 2 months of school that year became a total nightmare.
my dad started suddenly telling me that i looked like a weirdo and that kids at school probably saw me that way to.
he'd give long lectures about my style and how no ones gonna wanna marry a girl who dresses the way i do, but the way he spoke to me always felt like the way a father would speak to his rebelious son.
just his tone and constant swearing.
idk.
btw my sister was the one who got me into that emo style/culture and actually sported a haircut similar to mine, but much longer, so she didn't get much of the same treatment.
and i mean, i get it.
even i still cringe at the style i had back then, but looking back, i don't think the way he spoke to me was the way a father should ever speak to his own daughter.
i wonder if he acts that way towards me because maybe he wishes he had a son, but instead ended up with me?
everyone did assume i'd be a boy before my mom had me.
i am also certainly the tomboy of the sisters.
maybe that says something?
either way, i hate the way he speaks to me.
he has often told me i should be more feminine and whatnot.
not in a creepy way but in more of a "why can't you just be a normal daughter" type of way.
how can i feel feminine when you make fun of my style, call me a "fucking weirdo", constantly tell me to "be normal" and ask me if theres something wrong with me mentally?
a lot of kids go through stupid phases, but both my parents, mainly dad, made me feel as though it was much deeper than that.
i remember them telling me "you'll never be successful if you continue dressing that way".
they were truly disappointed in me.
a 13 year old girl, still going through puberty, starting to compare herself to other girls, starting to have her own insecurities, and on top of that... having her own father insult her looks and speak to her as though he's speaking with a grown man, thinking that maybe it'll get her to stop dressing that way and finally be normal.
let's just say it made me look and feel even less feminine.
i ended up cutting my hair into a pixie (kept the bangs long due to insecurities) and my parents went completely bonkers.
yes it was kinda bonkers and i was just a stupid kid, but their insults after that just made me feel even worse.
they started telling me i looked like a boy.
"why are you trying to look like a boy?"
"if you think you're ugly, why make yourself look worse?"
"are you mentally ill?
is that why you dress that way"  "do you know what a dyke is?
well you look like one.
", most of the insults coming from my dad.
he then one day asked me in front of everyone if i was a lesbian.
i said no and he accused me of lying.
i ran to my room crying, only to have mom come in and ask me the same question once more, but in a calmer tone.
no, i'm not a lesbian!
stop asking!
the tip on the icing was when i was sitting on the couch watching tv, my dad came and sat on the other sofa, mom was in living room to btw.
few seconds later he tells me, "do you know the short hair makes you look fat?"
my mom defended me and told him to stop and that he shouldn't say that.
it's funny cuz i had kinda thought i was chubby, as most young girls do, but he pretty much confirmed it for me in my mind.
i ditched the t shirts and wore only sweaters after that to cover myself.
he then starts calling me "sweater girl".
kinda funny...until he went out of his way to actually burn one of my sweaters.
and everyone laughed.
what's also funny is that i'd seen pictures of me at that age and i was thin, never fat.
guess that was just his way of trying to yet again convince me to "be normal".
the thing is, i know he loves me very much.
but he has issues controlling his anger and has his own insecurities, as well as problems with his own parents, specifically his mother.
it makes him say the stupidest things.
i just wish he was strong enough to have not had it affect our relationship.
because it's truly what's caused so much pain in my own life that wouldn't be there otherwise, like my social anxiety, my depression, the fact that i've been homeschooled for 4 years since i was 14,  all because i couldn't stand being around people anymore.
everyday is the same day for me.
every week is the same for me.
i don't go out.
i have no friends.
i'm am alone.
i know this is long.
i just really needed to vent this out somewhere.
i've spoken to my mom about this once or twice before, but she still doesn't get me, or maybe she just doesn't know how to help me.
but any advice or support would truly help me out guys.
i'm just some dumb college student that's probably gonna fail a class, for the second time.
i just wanted to type out what  i'm feeling way to vent.
i don't even think my problem is worth posting on here cause i'm are others with real problems.
but i just don't know what to do, i feel alone and wanted to talk anyone besides my family, who've i keep letting down.
i've been ignoring calls from my own parents cause i so scared on how they look me, same with my brothers.
i just keep disappointing them, they keep expecting more from me, i want more, but every time whenever i say that i would be better i fall into the same old habits.
is there something wrong with me?
i've realized that don't know how to be better anymore.
i keep getting the urge hurt myself and everytime i look in mirror i don't like what i see.
it's gotten to the point where i've often thought i be better off dead.
small problem, i know, i'm stupid for even typing this, i know, but i got no one else to talk to, sorry.
not a cry for help, just a really upsetting observation.
unemployment can be physically lonely, but the difference in lifestyle and priorities between you and those closest to you just makes it even lonelier, as circumstance prevents you from really relating to others on even the most superficial of levels anymore.
i’ve been fighting some really horrible depression bouts for the past couple months and this week in particular has been really stressful and depressive for me and i’ve just felt horrible.
i’ve been mad at the world and not wanting to exist or talk to anyone and it’s wearing on me.
today i got some good news and got to do some fun things so my mood was improving.
but a close online friend of mine gave me an update that their life is currently horrible and they’re really stressed.
obviously i’m being there for them but it’s been so long since i’ve felt happy i’ve been fighting myself not to sacrifice this rare good mood because they’re having a horrible time, and it’s not working.
i feel bad, they deserve a much better life, and it’s so hard for me to feel joy when people around me are miserable.
i’m hoping things go better for them soon because it’s really pulling me down as well because i have to be there for them, and now i feel guilty as hell for even having a good day and telling them, like i’m rubbing it in their face.
i wish they had a better life and i wish i didn’t feel horrible about wanting to be happy instead of depressed all the fucking time.
i’m trying so hard not to be so scared and sad, and it’s not working anymore.
i'm feeling bad rn and when i tell my friends about it they just ignore it
so my therapist has decided i need a hobby.
to “figure out who i am”.
the problem is, i don’t enjoy anything, my life is a job i hate and then coming home putting my kid to bed.
that’s my life.
i have never been into anything.
i don’t like sports, or beer, or board/ card games.
i don’t watch tv.
other than this account that my therapist begged me to try( i’ve never gotten any feed back from) i do not use the internet for anything other than the occasional purchase.
i have no interest in documentaries or reading.
i don’t have any social media.
i hate politics.
i don’t like camping or the outdoors.
my only friend is my wife.
and i don’t speak to my coworkers.
i don’t know what to do, other than to give up and tell my therapist to get bent.
so far it hasn’t seemed to help at all.
i dont know anymore..
i hate it i hate it i hate it i hate it.
there’s not a single moment when i’m talking to a person, whether online or in person, that i don’t think that they don’t hate me.
it’s a fucking vicious cycle too.
because i think my therapists hate me, then i stop talking about my problems and eventually stop going to appointments altogether.
and then i feel lonely because i isolate myself because i don’t want to talk to people.
then my parents tell me that they’ll help me pay for therapy.
and it repeats.
i hate it.
i hate myself.
why couldn’t one of my suicide attempts have worked.
i’m clearly a useless pile of garbage.
not sure if this belongs here or in a different sub or of it even belongs in a sub at all...if anyone has suggestions on where else to put this mess of a post let me know and i'll take it down.
i recently went to the dentist after 3 years.
i was never great at taking care of my teeth (mostly due to mental health reasons), and i avoided going to the dentist because of anxiety.
well, turns out i need a lot of dental work done.
i have multiple cavities (more than 10), need two crowns, had a root canal and possibly might need another root canal for a different tooth.
i decided to start all this work because i wanted to be more confident in my self and in my smile, but it's having the opposite effect.
three weeks ago i had fillings done on 3/4ths of my mouth.
ever since then my bite has just been off.
everytime i close my mouth to chew something they feel like they knock into each other.
i've gone to my dentist at least 4 times to get them adjusted but he never adjusts them right.
i tell him while i'm in the chair that they are still off and he basically tells me to deal with it.
last week i went in everyday to get them adjusted and i'm still stuck with pain and the inability to chew or close my mouth.
one of my teeth had an infection for nine months.
i was dealing with it, but needed a root canal.
a few days ago my dentist thought that the pain i was having from the bad adjustments on the fillings was due to the pain of the infected tooth, so he scheduled me an emergency root canal.
i'm now in pain from that, plus i'm still in pain from the badly adjusted fillings.
i still need the two crowns (one being on the tooth with the root canal i just had done) and the last 1/4th of my cavities done.
i might also need another root canal for a different tooth.
i haven't eaten solid food in 3 weeks.
i've broken down in tears and had panic attacks every other, and sometimes every day, from the pain of my teeth and the frustration of not being able to eat real food.
my boyfriend asks me if i want to get pizza or some other solid food and i have to say no even though i want that food so bad.
i know the minute i start chewing and those fillings hit each other, i know i'll be in intense pain so therefore i can't eat solid food.
i'm so sick of applesauce, yogurt, pudding, mashed potatoes and ice cream.
it's been three weeks and i just want to eat some real food.
i've lost 10 pounds because i'm not getting the proper nutrients for my body no matter how much food i eat.
let's add in the financial stress too.
i'm 23 and on state insurance so basically nothing is covered and i'm paying for this out of pocket.
my parents refuse to help and i just graduated college last year.
with covid, i'm unable to get a job in my field so i'm stuck working a minimum wage job that i don't even want to go to anymore because i'm so depressed and in pain from my teeth.
i also work night shift and my dentist is only open 9-5, which is when i sleep.
so, i've been getting very little sleep in an attempt to try and make my teeth better and to not be in pain.
the fact that i have to keep going to the dentist daily is making me lose sleep and lose my mind.
i'm also ruining my relationship with my boyfriend because all i do is complain to him about my teeth or that my teeth hurt.
even when i don't mean to.
he knows something is wrong and everytime intell him it's my teeth he does a big sigh and i can tell he's sick of me telling him.
when i have mental breakdowns because of it, i know he is just comforting me because he has no other choice.
i feel so bad because i'm being a horrible girlfriend who just wants to cry and complain about my teeth.
i haven't been intimate or spent any time with him because of the mental state i'm in and because of the pain i'm in.
it's only a matter of time before he breaks up with me over this.
i'm so sick of my teeth, i honestly sometimes wish that they would just be knocked out of my face so i didn't have to deal with them and the stress they are causing me.
they have caused me more harm than good.
they hurt, they're causing me not to be able to eat properly, they're ruining my sleep schedule, they're ruining my finances, they're ruining my relationship with my boyfriend and they're ruining my mental health.
i'm mentally drained and i don't know what to do anymore.
i wake up crying because of all the harm they've done to my life in the past few months.
like during my breakdowns i have suicidal thoughts over this stress of my teeth.
(want to disclose that i'm not feeling suicidal right now, but in the past have been suicidal over my teeth and got help for it).
i wish i never would have gone to the dentist to find out what work i needed done.
all it did was put me in a worse place.
you know those movies where it’s 2 people on a road trip, and by the end they are best friends always supporting each other.
i really want that.
i’ve never had many friends, lost most of them.
i’d love to just roam the earth with another person and smile together.
but i’ll never find that.
instead i’ve been stuck alone for 5 years with nobody, just my own suicidal thoughts.
i woke up at 10:30 am, turned my alarm off and went back to bed.
my mom woke me up near 2:00 pm because i had a therapy session.
couldn't even talk during therapy and just went through most of it without saying a word.
ate almost nothing, took my medicine that i should've taken hours earlier, went back to bed.
woke up at 6:00 pm and ate a sandwich.
haven't eaten any meals today and been almost 2 days without showering.
i'm sat in front of my computer screen doing nothing because i lack the willpower to do anything.
i don't even know why i'm writing this, i've posted here before and most of the times never even got a comment, but whatever, just wanted to take this off my chest and don't trust anyone to say it to.
hey friends, long time lurker but here's my first post.
this aast year has really sucked.
i can't "comaplain" because i've kept my job and have been able to work from home.. baut that's been so so lonely.
i miss my work friends, i miss awkwaardly passing people going in and out of the restroom, i even miss the weird exchanges with certain coworkers.
i miss my friends.
i miss going to church.
i m iss grabbing lunch with someone on any given day.
when can we get back to "normal"?!
end rant, but i guess i'm curious if anyone feels this way too?
anyone else feel incredibly anxious first thing waking up.
and that you wake up very early in the summer when it gets light early?
worst part of the day for me.
my heart is pounding, thoughts racing, have to go to the bathroom etc.
so recently i’ve been feeling down.
i just feel like my entire life is just constant stress, that no matter how much schoolwork i do, theres always more and its been putting a strain on me.
i also act differently around different friends and different when with family and i don’t know which is my actual self.
i think i’ve just been fabricating personalities for so long that i forgot what my real one was.
and heres the depression part.
recently, whenever i am wrong or i don’t know how to do something, i’ll berate myself and convince myself that i’m useless.
i considered suicide but thought that my parents would miss me.
i also don’t know if my friends actually like me or if im being clingy and they actually hate me but they are confrontational enough to tell me.
for an example of what i tend to do when i feel this way, yesterday, i couldn’t understand my homework, so i cried for thirty minutes, got a bloody nose and then told myself i was worthless.
i don’t feel like i’m worth anything but the issue is, i don’t know if i actually believe that or if i’m just telling myself that to be edgy.
so thats the entire thing but i kinda need to rant, so i’ll add some things here but they’re not really relevant to my question.
so i’m bisexual, i told my mom, step dad, brother, and grandma.
i never told my dad and i don’t know why.
so i’m also about 60% sure i’m genderfluid, but the last 40% is mainly because, like with my depression, i don’t know if its just a phase.
sorry about this, this was mainly a rant and i have no idea if anyone can answer my question with this, so i’ll just to a tldr.
i think i’m worthless, useless, and that my friends hate me, but i don’t know if thats my actual thoughts or if im just being edgy.
i've been seeing my therapist monthly for several years.
my husband and i also see an lmft bi-weekly and have been for the past year-ish.
our lmft suggested i ask for more frequent appointments with my therapist, which i agreed to do.
unfortunately, at my last appointment with my therapist (29 april), right as i was about to ask, he apologized saying he did not have even a half hour open in may, so offered 8 june.
i agreed to that because he mentioned scheduling "...for my more needy patients," implying i'm not one of those.
i still felt discouraged, sad, and cried after that appointment because one of the last things he told me was "you miss your partner," and it hit hard how much i miss my husband.
(see note at bottom)

now earlier in april, my therapist offered me a 30 minute call out of the blue saying "i know you don't have any support so here i am," which moved me almost to tears because i know he has a lot of patients.
i work for the same organization just in a different department, and have my own patients to keep track of so i understand the stress it can cause.
perhaps i am incorrect in assuming i would be seen more frequently if he thought i needed it.
i know i need to communicate this, i'm just not sure how.
i also feel fearful of becoming a needy patient.
just fyi, my husband is in military training and will be away for at least a year.
our home is an 8-10 hour flight from any friends or family, which is also how far his training is from me.
i have mdd, insomnia, and recently diagnosed add/adhd.
i'm used to being depressed/tired for no reason, but now it's worsened by my situation and i do feel i am struggling to cope.
thank you to anyone who read this.
tired of being ghosted before the conversation begins.
tired of being interested in someone only to find out they're in a relationship.
tired of people not being interested in me at all.
i don't think i'll find love.
i'm only 21f but it's painful as hellwhen everyone around you had a partner and i don't.
how do i accept my reality?
i don't deserve love or anything of the sort.
the more i read the news and everyone’s reaction to said news the more i’m convinced the human race is nothing more then a bunch of imbeciles who argue with each other.
this country is not united it was never united we just say that to our kids to protect them from the harsh reality that we are nothing.
people putting other lives in danger because they don’t believe in science.
people trying to sabotage others careers because they don’t like them.
the fall of humanity will be by humanity itself due to its inability to come together.
now this post will go unnoticed as per fucking usual.
like this place is a place for death notes and normal depressed people activities.
who joins this place to hear about the trending articals from suicidal ppl?
there are a lot of things i can do.
i can go play a video game or watch a show.
i can talk to friends.
i can work.
i can study

i can go out to eat

any of these things might make you feel good for a minute.
then they end, and you return to your baseline feeling.
if that baseline feeling is self loathing, existential dread or boredom then what's the point?
every possible activity is fleeting.
i feel like life is a series of distractions, then i turn the monitor off or go sit on my bed and i realize i've felt the same way for a decade.
i don't see any point in it anymore.
i could move or switch degrees or fix my addiction or try and meet people.
at the end of the day i'd sit on my bed and feel the same.
if its all just distracting yourself until you die, why do anything?
nothing lasts.
jeez i have not been here in awhile i definitely should have revisited sooner.
honestly life didn’t get much better a couple of advances but mostly things are still static.
i started a delivery job at my uncle’s restaurant and it’s been paying well, i’ve saved up enough to maintain my car, help with rent, and even buy my own ticket for morocco.
it sounds great but i’ve also been lying to all of my friends and coworkers that i’m attending school.
to the point that i’m making lies about days i can’t work to make it more believable.
i sent my application for school way too late and haven’t received a response back.
in my parents eyes i wasted a year, because i didn’t go to school right after.
i’m now scrambling to try to apply to the community college and get my shit together.
and by scrambling i mean keeping it in the back of my mind until i eventually crash and burst out on the wrong person, or actually apply.
i can’t even lie to myself and say i’m trying my best.
i went out for ftour (breaking fast for ramadan) at the restaurant i work at and when we were cleaning up and trying to take our food home i got called fat by my coworker alex for taking food home.
“he’s already 300lb why would he want more!
?”
even though i laughed it off and my uncle wanted to yell at him i just cleared the situation so nobody had to feel bad.
but truly that shit hurt me, i couldn’t ruin the night and it honestly pushed me to come back here.
almost a safe zone were i actually just let it out.
i’m having thoughts of starving myself and as horrible as it seems i’m honestly thinking about it as a viable option.
i’m gonna attempt to wake up in the morning to go to the gym and try to work out again after not going for more than a month.
shit was simple and god do i miss it, i see my friends who are the same age as me, and coworkers younger then me with a future already started or already laid out for them and i’m just gasping for air trying to catch up.
i’ve been playing way to many video games lately and i want to attempt a week break although it will be hard i think it will reset me mentally.
of course this is a lot of motivation and shit talking from an overweight dude at 3am but i have to talk to someone.
my parents are too old and don’t have an understanding of where i am and it will only make me feel worse from their textbook response, my sister has her own life there’s no need for me to ruin it with a stupid rant, she has enough on her plate.
i need to fucking get it together or my life is worthless.
if i don’t get it together then killing myself would be the best option, as extreme as it sound, no weight is better then dead weight.
i've had suicidal thoughts before.
but they're usually intrusive thoughts, not something i would consider.
one of my biggest fears was killing myself out of impulse.
throwing everything away because of a couple bad thoughts.
and now i'm here.
i have no friends.
i cant talk to anyone.
and now i'm actually considering it.
i really just don't know what to do.
i am so pathetic.
i don’t see any way i will be able to amount to something in this world, and it is too painful to get through each day let alone try my odds.
i wish i could quit smoking, work harder, be nicer to people, but everything is so hard when the only thing on my mind is death.
the book is available [here]( from the wellness society.
everyone right now needs a little extra help and hopefully, this e-book can assist some of you in uncovering the toolset you need during this abnormal time, or at least it might help with bridging the gap between now and when you may be able to seek more professional assistance.
obviously, it's not a solution to all problems, and some of you are going to be going through a lot more than others, but i hope many of you can find it useful.
stay safe, stay healthy.
im 21, f.. i know wikipedia isn't the most reliable thing, but i just learned this, and now it's just making me so anxious.
i've seen people split hot dogs apart by putting an electrode into it, it very quickly splits and then starts to give off smoke.
i've also seen people split water into hydrogen and oxygen by simply allowing some current to flow through the water - and often it causes explosions or fires, because hydrogen is flammable.
i thought nerve cells and muscle cells just used chemicals and proteins to transmit signals and make things move, and not actual electricity like out of a high-tension power line.. it makes me really anxious because i used to have seizures and they could come back any time, actually i get muscle twitches all day every day, they are seizure-like but may not be caused by epilepsy.
now whenever i get those twitches i think those wires are short circuiting and im going to suddenly see sparks come off my skin and set my clothes on fire.
or my leg will suddenly heat up and cook itself from short circuiting and ill catch on fire.
also what if my nerves malfunction and short circuit, and i shake a friend's hand and i electrocute them to death or something?
i wouldnt be able to live with that

i havent slept for days bc i keep thinking of this and doing research on it is only confirming my fears i feel like i want to literally rip all my nerves out my body

so i've been having these feelings of anxiety and stress whenever i think of going to a full time job.
i'm graduating university in a few months and i just find the future scary... the pandemic took over a year out of my life, i was hoping before, to explore more  about myself, and about possibilities after uni, but now i guess life was pretty much on pause and i just feel anxious and stressed just thinking about the fact that i'm graduating and will have to work full time.
anybody else can relate??
here's the video i made about my anxiety of going to a full time job, i feel like many people here could relate to that.
just know you're not alone in this &gt;&gt; [scared to go to work?
me too](

please let me know if you have some tips on this topic!
i know work is essential for living and i'm trying  to look forward to it and find some good things about this huge change.
would love to hear your thoughts.
this stress is killing me
 [\#resignedwithoutajob]( anyone done this recently?
what makes you take this risky decision?
i’m in my mid twenties (f,25) and living with mother.
lately all she does is say negative things about me and it really puts me down.
i feel like i do everything wrong.
in my work life, my love life, social life, everything.
i was dating someone new and we recently broke up.
it was so abrupt and the circumstances suck, and now we aren’t talking after getting into an argument.
it’s hard to not let it get to me.
i keep thinking what if i had been more supportive?
what should i have done to fulfill their needs while grieving...they say they won’t date anyone else but what if they’re lying .. thoughts keep racing and making my heart beat fast 

i’m still unsure what i’m going to do career wise and if i can afford to live alone and if i won’t feel anxious living alone...


all my thoughts at once make me feel really stressed out and it’s keeping me up at night.
i don’t sleep until 6 am sometimes 😞
 

23 female.. there's this person (mark davis) 47, m. i've been fixated on since around 2015. it's like when i saw him, there was this instant interest/bond.
ever since, it's like i have to learn everything about him, even the most minute detail like his favorite color, what his medical history is, details about his job (prison warden) his political views, birthday (december 25th) everything, and they're quite similar to mine.
when i found out what his full name was, i was literally giddy and in a daze for a couple days.
just seeing the videos he's made makes me happy, i can be really stressed out or just feeling depressed, or anxious.
but then he makes me feel better.
he's super dorky but i find that adorable, he has this kind of charming energy and a voice that i find soothing.
(he sounds exactly like jello biafra)

i haven't met him in person yet, but i hope to eventually.
he isn't exactly a friendly person all of the time, he can be an asshole to people at times.
i remember impulsively going full-hate mode on him when he said that he hated children.
then i snapped out of it..but i'm still attached to him and sometimes he even finds his way into my dreams then i get upset because it seems real.
he comes into my mind several times a day, like during dinner time i think, hmm i wonder what he's eating for dinner, or wondering when he's got home from work, when he'll be sleeping and then imagining him nice and comfy in bed.
i wonder how he's doing right now.
i've had these horrible nightmares where i'll dream that he died and i'd wake up literally sobbing, if he died i can't imagine how depressed i'd feel.
it makes me feel physically sick to imagine anything happening to him.
i had this dream where he was found dead in a pit of spikes and there was blood everywhere and his eyes and mouth were wide open.
then i felt him and he was freezing cold.. it messed me up for days

i keep feeling nauseous whenever i think about him like i've been on a rollercoaster or something.
problem is...i have no way of directly contacting him and i'm not even sure if he'd want me as a friend or not.
i don't know what to do and i don't feel like i want to discuss this with a doctor in person, because i'd seem crazy and stalker-ish.
hey everyone!
just wanted to let you know that's there's a free session happening this sunday on the yogic management of stress - the platform is only a month or so old so it's a little buggy but the sessions are conduct by professionals who have decades of experience - these conceptualizations, tips and techniques really help.

i’m an 18 year old male.
i have treatment resistant bipolar depression, severe social anxiety, panic attacks, aspergers.
and besides that i’m going through a lot of financial problems.
the stress is starting to get to the point where my heart starts to hurt so badly i can barely manage to move at times.
besides this i am getting trouble breathing, constant migraines, stomach pain and random aches.
but the heart is what hurts the most.
i’m concerned i might have a heart attack.
when it starts hurting it’s easily the most intense pain i’ve felt.
and i’ve been through a lot of painful situations.
i don’t know what to do.
could the stress cause a heart attack?
and if so what do i do?
i have no way to get rid of the stress.
i’ve been seeing doctors and trying treatments for the past 12 years of my life.
and i’ve been on over 30 different medications with no luck.
i had chronic stress for about 11 months last year convincing myself i had different types of cancer and now i have constant nausea, has anyone else had this?
people keep telling me i've ruined my body with the level of stress and anxiety i endured last year :/ can't see how this would make me this nauseous.
hello everyone, 

i have a stressful week, i had to go though of stressing out about this settlement meeting this morning.
well the one who i'm suing didn't show up, so i was asked if i wanted to go ahead and go to court.... of course i said yes but now i have to send all my evidence by email to the people i'm suing because they do not have a lawyer either... i do have a lawyer and this is what she told me to do.
i am scare of doing this because they could email me back and start things... im scared for my health, i know i have to do it but i don't know if i should due it today or another time and should i make a fake email?...
i'm going after ex landlords, i have videos and photos and voice recording of what everyone has done and did., and found out today they didn't send in any evidence at all....
hey everyone, hope you're dong ok.
a few days ago i started getting pain in the left side of my chest.
it mostly happens when i lie down but sometimes happens for no reason.
is it maybe stress?
for some extra information i'm only 18 and i'd say i'm quite healthy aside from endometriosis and of course mental health problems.
i used to get chest pain at a time when my anxiety was at it's worst but it's weird that it's happening now.
i am stressed but it's just the usual.
when do you think i should start worrying?
so, i've a elder brother whom i used to respect so much and i used to think he's the only one who understands me and cares about me the most.
my family is so conservative and they don't want me to wear short dresses, have guy friends and not even close girl friends.
so i had always been oppressed and as a result i'm less expressive and i'm also less social and my this behaviour bothers my family a lot.
and my brother too is closed minded so, i don't have a choice but keep secrets that i do wear short dress when i'm out and i've a boyfriend.
i had the habit of writing diaries and it was something that always helped me to be calm, feel light, control my anxiety.
i'd to feel my diary as someone just mine and i'd write anything in there.
my every feelings, everything i had ever to say, and everything i never wanted anyone to know.
but my brother that always been curious about my life, i used to think it's cause he cares about me, but he stalking be on social media was really making me anxious, so i blocked him.
later he suddenly stopped talking to me, and i kept thinking what wrong did i do.
later my mom told me that he read my diary, that broke me, med me feel exposed ( i wasn't doing anything wrong in my life, i used to be just myself, atleast while writing my diary) and he read it all.
he was supposed to know the things he read.
i was so disappointed, so frustrated, so angry and it still makes me anxious now and then.
but i couldn't gather courage to question him.
i fear he'll question me about why do i do things he doesn't want me to do.
and ik i should fight and i can complain against him if he tries to hurt me, but the place where i live, the process is so hard, i'll always be blamed and idk what to do.
he didn't have any right to read my personal diary, i atleast expected him to have that much sense.
and the worst part is, i can't write anymore.
i tried writing on my diary after that, but i just couldn't.
ig the fear is still there, i feel like it won't help me anymore, i can't just mek it.
i feel like it's no more something of my own.
and i feel more frustrated now, i'm more anxious now.
and idk what should i do.
i'm recently thinking maybe i'll leave that diary just aside and my myself and new diary and keep a lock in it and try writing in it.
coz it's hard to go though stuffs and not being able to take it out.
i don't have enough friends either with whom i can talk about anything without feeling judged.
what do you all think?
please help me out.
hi folks i wanna reveal in this post what is the most important cause behind your psychological challenges, starting from your procrastination, self sabotaging, anxiety, failed relationships .. 
well as humans we do anything we could to feel like we're in control of our daily lives, the moment this sense of control started to get challeged spontaneously we resist and fight back to regain this control that we use to feel inside, because falsely we thought this is the only way to feel secure and successful, but as we know if we get to dig a little bit deeper on how life and this universe operates, we will discover that there's order and chaos as a core principal in this universe, in other words if you're always doing your best to eliminate chaos aka tension and life's challeges from your life, you'll start to deny an important part inside yourself which is the desire to evolve with world around you .. and that's the starting of all psychological pathologies .. 

basically your internal resistance to your life condition and reality is what getting you to suffer and feel depressed and anxious, if you just embrace life as it is by accepting it how it is, without any expectations or the desire to control your surroundings .. you'll feel peace and sense of security inside your psyche, suddenly your true self aka your authentic self will comes out and the reward of being able to achieve that is you'll be able to do things effortlessly without draining a big part of your energy on resisting or combating your emotions about what is going on around you .. 

hope you like this post for further discussions dm me guys for any questions
so i just left a military group.
i shall explain stuff first.
my country has a post school activity which is basically a military activity but it’s milder, adjusted and suitable for 13-16 year olds,  there are 2 branches of the activity such as a freestyle group with foot drills and a activity where its like the first branch but with guns.
so i joined the gun group and the exercises and drills were easy to learn but hard to do.
i messaged my ic and he said i could leave and he doesn’t blame us because of the injuries he had also faced.
i then left and felt like an outcast even tho my fellow members said its ok.
so what i am asking is that if any of you guys can help me cope with my stress.
i (28f) absolutely hate dating but i want love.
i’m constantly stressing myself out whenever i become interested in a new guy.
i stress because im constantly asking myself if im not good enough for him... especially when he doesn’t respond for hours.
i stress when he says he wants to go out but flakes last minute.
i stress when i’m with him and i can’t read if he’s interested.
then i stress when i think he’s just being nice when i ask him something and he gives a good answer.
of course i always play it cool.
like laughing it off when he flakes.
or saying no worries when he cancels.
or giving him space when i don’t want to look too clingy.
but inside i’m going crazy!
i want to turn this worrying off.
does anyone else have this issue?
i don’t like feeling this way and i don’t know how to stop feeling so stressed about this!
for  my thesis i've created a web-app where over 140 people from 27  countries around the world have released their 1 minute anxiety monster.

hi everyone,

i have come to realise that my mind and body is defaulted towards being stressed.
from the minute i open my eyes, to the minute i close them i am constantly "doing" things and feeling like i am a few steps behind.
so for me it seems like an ingrained habit that i sort of deault to constantly.
does anyone have any ideas on how to break the habit of stressfully doing things and balancing it with just being?
i do meditate, yoga and those kinds of things but even that can sometimes be a stressful "must".
any thoughts would be much appreciated!
hi reddit,

i'm in need of some advice.
2 years ago i worked myself into a burn-out of which i am still recovering.
i worked in an online marketing team that had a lot of desk/computer hours.
i still don't have a lot of energy and i still feel stressed, emotionally drained from time to time and still have a hard time living a normal life.
however, my biggest problem is that i cannot do computer work anymore.
whether it's gaming, watching video's, school work or just browsing for fun, i cannot last longer than 45 minutes without having one or more of these following symptoms:
- lightheadedness 
- heavy head
- pshyical stress, my body feels pumped up like it want's to run a marathon 
- concentration issues

i do not seem to have these symptoms when staring at my phone screen or tv screen.
i've always spent a lot of time behind my computer (gaming, chatting with friends etc) but now i cannot even have 1/8th the screen time that i could endure.
it kinda feels like my brain associates just sitting behind a computer with enourmous amounts of stress.
my question is, is there a way i can train my body or mind that i do not feel stressed anymore when sitting behind a computer?
i know that i'm not fully recovered yet and that i cannot expect big results but it's a big part of my life that i don't want to lose.
i already correct my shoulders when they are tense, i take regular breaks and i don't do work that stresses me out.
even gaming (which is one of my favourite things) i cannot seem to do anymore....

some advice would be appreciated!
tl:dr: there is nothing that stressed me out more than sitting behind a computer screen, tips?
i wanna start off my saying a bit about me.
i'm a 19 year old \[male\]  in first year of uni -(maths&amp;physics) and i've: played the piano since i was six, produce music (some of which is now on spotify) and i am a "triathlete" (train 12-15 hours/week) ps.
running is my entire life - though i'm not great at it yet.
my flatmate, wendy, is one of my best friends.
over the pandemic we spent around 5 months living on our own (in the same bed since not in uni halls) and everything was great.
i have never been in a relationship and i am not ready for one, i made that crystal clear to her before i even invited her to stay with me over the 5 months.
we had somewhat a physical relationship, though we never had sex.
she asked why and the main was because i didn't want to lead her on, i told her that and would regularly check if she was okay living with me despite not having an emotional relationship - i know that wouldn't work for some people and i really liked spending my time with her.
throughout this time i didn't see anybody from uni (i was home) though i kept in close contact with a girl called lisa.
i picked up a few running and cycling injuries and had to give up training for a few weeks and it fucking broke me (still recovering, but doing much better).
recently, wendy told me she is in love with me.
i friendzoned her and immediately stopped anything physical that we had ever done - i really want this friendship to work.
but she is not okay.
i have spent 3 nights over the past two weeks (where i go to sleep at 4am, waking up at 7am for training) with her as she's having a panic attack .
i am trying everything i can.
she is now back home since my mum (a qualified counsellor) conviced here that staying in uni is not a good idea - though wendy wouldn't listen to me when i said it.
on top of this, my cycling injury is now back and i am picking up a bad shoulder from swimming and s&amp;c work.
music rooms aren't open and so i haven't practiced piano in a month (which is a big fucking deal).
i can't run/cycle/swim how i would like to, i can't practice music and i have no motivation to produce.
i hate my uni degree (it's really hard and i have no motivation) though i know when out of this rut i will begin to enjoy it again.
and, worst of all, i can't stop thinking about lisa.
i thought i didn't want a relationship but she is fucking everything to me.
what is wendy gonna do when she knows how i feel about lisa?
i'm scared she's gonna do something severe.
i don't know if i'm falling inlove with lisa but all i know is that i would die for her.
you're probably wondering why i have titled this what i have, but i can do a lot of great things (cocky, i know) and yet i still look in the mirror and see a 'failure'.
i just want to be satisfied with who i am but i have no love for myself.
i have dealt with "depression" (not really, but feeling constantly down for months on end) and a developing ed which i have now overcome - i don't want it to come back.
ps.
i can't talk about this in person, i have not told anybody how i feel, i have tried so many times but i just see it as weak and pathetic (never cried infront of anyone sober either).

i feel like i'm about to have a panic attack because i let myself procrastinate packing up my dorm room until the last minute.
its 2am and i have until 12pm to pack and i still have to sleep because i have a 2-3hr drive home tomorrow/today.
i cant focus on anything and it's making me so stressed.
i just feel like screaming.
well here as the title says, i just feel like crying most of the times at night.
i'm in university and have been taking it online and have been at home.
this has really made my mental health decline tbh.
i've been stressed by a lot of things and when i tried to tell my mom that i have been stressed all she said is i can't be stressed because i don't do anything all day.
after she said that it made me feel like i can't tell her anything.
just because i don't do much but school doesn't mean i can't be stressed.
i have a hard time concentrating at home and just feel unmotivated.
i'm also really stressed about what to do after university graduation.
it's just so much to be stressed about so it really hurt my mom doesn't believe i have any stress.
:/ i just don't know what to do anymore.
i'm recovering of a burn out and i'm learning more about myself.
**measuring**

i have noticed i've got 4 points where i can measure my stress:

- physical
- mental
- emotional
- my motivation and perseverance


when i'm stressed:

- physically i just get pains everywhere when my body is in stress.
my muscles ache or problems with my bowel.
- mentally i have no concentration to do normal thinking, analysing or problem solving.
watching/reading/listen is just a no go.
- emotionally i cry often when an emotion pops up.
i can't control my emotions, they take over.
- my motivation/perseverance is minimal to not there at all, i can hardly take care of myself (eat, drink, hygiene) so doing things i want or need to do are just out of the question.
when i'm in this fase i'm out.
i just can sleep, i walk because i need to and i'm happy my parents provide me with food.
**making my own stress thermometer**

i made a chart where i put the 4 measures next to each other and made 4 rows under it:

- red: burn out 😫
- orange: stressed 😖
- yellow: minor stressed 😞
- green: peaceful 😌

in every cell i put indicators.
for example when i'm in yellow i can still watch a new movie, but not in orange, but usually not fully just about an hour.
in orange i loose motivation.
this way i can track my daily stress level.
**origin of my stress**

i know i have some beliefs and expectations that cause me to ignore my feelings of need for rest.
it feels like the emotions of the beliefs and expectations are prioritised higher then my feeling of tiredness.
actually my whole wellbeing is prioritised less then my beliefs and expectations.
**how i plan to recover**

i'm resting right now, i'm lucky i get the time from my job to be sick and get paid leave.
daily i rest, walk, attend to my plants, clean up my house, i try to do at least 2 or 3 small tasks which i know are good for my wellbeing even though it can be hard.
i'm mindful, i meditate and i'm very aware of my emotions.
when they pop up i try to understand what belief or expectation is behind the emotions.
when they pop up when i need to make a difficult choice i choose rationally for my wellbeing.
rest, rest and more rest (physical, mental and emotional).
even though it takes a lot of courage to overcome the emotions i get not listening to my beliefs and expectations.
i'm not helping anybody when i can't even do things for myself!
after making a choices like this: i get proud of myself because i choose me 🥳

**motivation and perseverance**

i have noticed that my motivation and perseverance grows when i'm more rested again 😃 so, i started to do things that i love to do and give me satisfaction.
i would love if someone could help me get to my interviews tomorrow.
i will pay back at first paycheck as i would be grateful knowing someone cares
i’m looking for some advice for someone who’s maybe dealt with similar so i can get some sort of resolution.
i’ve had debilitating head pressure in the top back of my head along with lightheadedness, woozy feeling (like my head is swaying) faint feeling that comes and goes and blurry vision.
my head also feels like it’s spasms inside at times.
has anyone dealt with this in terms of anxiety?
what medications helped?
any exercises to make it better?
how long did it take to resolve or at least calm down?

hi, so this all started 18 months ago when i underwent a very stressful period moving countries for a new job.
since then, i've had various issues.
it started with minor skin issues then almost a year ago i started having trouble sleeping.
fast forward to now and after getting blood tests done loads of times and multiple trips to the er, i finally understand that i have been through chronic stress and i'm now freaking out about the inflammation in my body the past 18 months and the possible serious diseases i could get in the future.
i'm not out of the chronic stress yet but now i finally understand it i know how to beat it.
i'm going on antidepressants, going to start therapy, adapting an anti cortisol diet and continue exercising.
i hope that all these things will work.
i'm so scared of the future now but i know i need to just focus on the present and getting myself fully back to normal.
it just upsets me so much that i was in full health before the stupid move and now im not sure what the future holds.
i'm also angry at my doctor.
he should have explained this to me.
he wanted to treat me with antidepressants a year ago but i didn't listen because i didn't understand how they would help me.
i feel so stupid.
has anyone been through anything similar and how has your recovery gone?
 

stress is usually brought on by anxiety and when this particular condition is addressed, it is possible to avoid building up the stress levels within the daily functions of the individual.
addressing the underlying causes of the stress, would better help the individual deal or change the circumstances that cause the stress, and thereby learning to comfortably adapt and cope with work place situations.
the following are some recommendations on how to manage stress at work effectively.
**at work** 

giving up coffee – most people are really unaware of the effect coffee has on the body and mind systems.
coffee helps to further elevate any conditions into hyper activity thus creating the ideal combination that further enhances any stressful circumstances.
the coffee flows into the blood and causes the adrenaline to be overly stimulated thus putting the brain into overdrive.

the home environment can usually seem like a battlefield as there are usually individual of various ages under one roof.
this alone is a stress contributing factor, as there are many needs and wants to satisfy and cope with.
with a little correct and comfortable practices, the stress levels for all concerned can be minimized.
the following are some of the common area that should be given due consideration in the quest to limit the occurrences of stress

**at home**

 being organized is probable the best way to beat the stress condition from being a regular occurrence.

it is popularly believed that if an individual is not exposed to the stress causing circumstances, then the occurrence of the stress will be very unlikely and therefore not a dominant factor to contend with on a daily basis.
this has some truth to it, but it is not always possible to avoid or remove oneself from a circumstance that will eventually cause the stress to surface.
one of the ways that is recommended by most experts on the subject of stress management, is to ease the tension and in doing so bring the stress levels under adequate control.
the following are some tips on how to ease tension and reduce stress levels significantly.

it has been blamed for excess hair loss (medical name-androgenetic alopecia) although the molecular steps of hair loss in men and women are not fully understood.
this hormone is secreted in the testis of males and the ovaries of females, although men produce more of it.
various kinds of mental behaviour are not only subject to influence by environment and genetics but also day-to-day hormonal changes.
for example, stress can also inhibit testosterone synthesis and hence lead to decreased levels of it secretion [for more](
 

both parties should be made aware of the fact that it is almost always impossible to change another person overnight or even over a long period of time.
accepting this is the first step in managing the relationship without adding stress to the combination.
working toward coping with the existing situation, instead of trying to force a change will be a lot easier and certainly less [stressful]( 

changing oneself is definitely more doable that attempting to change someone else.

managing [stress]( adequately would require the need to first be able to identify the main causes of the presence of stress within the confines of the individual’s life.
when this has been identified then the relevant steps can be taken to address the stress inducing circumstances.
1st step

 some of the more common signs of stress are nervousness, withdrawal, constant tiredness, frequent headaches, increased use of [alcohol]( smoking and other unhealthy habits, an unexpected loss or increase in the diet intake or body weight, restless sleep and irrational emotional outbursts and behaviour patterns.

does anybody else get this feeling from stress like you're not in control of your own body in any way?
like you can't think critically, or sometimes at all.
your motions are like jelly, and even when you get control, you're super uncoordinated or a clumsy.
in social situations, you feel more like a passenger for your own body who has no idea what to say or do but still has the capacity to be angry at yourself for not saying anything or doing something.
it's like this self-awareness that stops short of allowing me to do anything.
i have a lot of stressors in my life, and i can't help but think they've burnt me out so much so that i've become subject to these things.
i've been told before to prioritize or to take on less things as a solution, but to me that's synonymous with settling on being capable of less than i thought i'm capable of.
how do people function with high stress?
how do you groom yourself to do that?
i've lived like this for so many years and thought it would just come with experience, but now it just feel harder than its ever been
what works for me is writing on my gratitude journal i take a moment in the morning and night to write about my day... and it helps me to reduce stress, see the good things in my life and keep a positive mindset.
the journal has pretty nice stuff like prompts and activities, weekly goals, monthly planner so i like it a lot.

i'm so stressed more than normal.
i'm still in the grieving process since july 2019 when my papaw died.
he was like my dad.
now fast fwd to now my grandma is selling her house because her dr stated she doesn't need to be living by herself.
i can't live with her because i have my own family and my apt is not big enough for her and she wouldn't be able to handle my kids all the time.
plus she's starting to get frail (my grandma is super strong and looks 20 years younger than her age of 75).
so she's going to live with my aunt in iowa and she's all i got.
my sister barely talks to me because of other choices and my medical condition (epilepsy) so i don't get to see my niece and nephew very often.
i don't speak to my mother, stepfather if you want to call him that and my brother for other personal reasons.
so i feel like i'm being left alone even though i have my 3 kids and fiancée.
i see her everyday and talk to her everyday my kids get dropped off there after school and we go see her.
i feel like i'm just losing her like i did papaw and then when she passes i'm going to lose her again.
i'm extremely sad.
yes i'm depressive and on medication but medication can't help block all emotions that are happening in short periods of time.
i can't talk to a therapist face to face because they won't be back in the office till july and i can't talk to them through zoom or on the phone because i need someone there to call me out when i try to hold things back.
plus before this i constantly stay stressed and my anxiety meds just put me to sleep.
i don't want to be this stressed out all the time.
just needed to talk.

i'm only a 3rd year grad student and from now itself i'm getting very anxious and stressed about my career and life, i often feel people are constantly blaming me and i don't feel heard at all.
any advice  that might help me?
hi, just wanted to ask if stress can cause many many weird physical symptoms?
all started when my taste and smell senses decreased a lot for a few weeks, took 3 covid tests and all negative.
during the same time my right arm started to hurt, then my right leg and some time later my whole right side of body went numb (not like paralized numb but skin feels numb and tight).
i also have buzzing in my arm and leg and my fingers feel stiff (a few days ago my little toe in right leg went numb too - like really can’t move it).
and my jaw hurts a lot on the right side - that jaw thing has been going of for the last year, dentists say nothing is wrong.
i noticed that i clenched my teeth sometimes so thought that maybe i am just so stressed and this is the outcome.
but right now i don’t clench my teeth but my jaw pain is still back (with all these new symptoms).
anyway i have been to my doctor and neurologist and right now i am waiting for mris (neuro wants to eliminate ms).
when this all first started i didn’t feel more stressed or anything but now of course i am stressed.
i feel kinda fine some days and then the other days (like today) my arm and leg are in so much pain (i think nerve pain, my skin feels very sensitive and almost painful to touch too) and i just feel so weak and tired and only want to stay in bed and feel like i want to cry.
so i guess my question is that could all these symptoms be because of stress or anxiety?
my neuro seems nice but all the other doctors seemed to think and said that “maybe you are just stressed”.
of course i don’t want to get diagnose like ms from my neuro but at the same time i really would not want to believe that just stress could cause these kind of symptoms.
have anyone had similar physical symptoms and turned out it was just stress or anxiety?
could stress really make me be physically in pain or numb like this?
has anyone dealt with daily head pressure from stress/anxiety that has lasted many months 24/7 and it does not respond to over the counter medication?
since october of last year i have been dealing with head pressure, brain fog, lightheadedness, faint feeling, pressure behind eyes etc that has limited me to basically doing nothing every day due to feeling out of it.
i have went to neurologist, ent, eye doctor, hospital twice, gotten lab work such as ct, mri, mra, and mrv of the brain and every scan is clear and every doctor can't find anything.
these symptoms all came on during an insanely stressful time at the end of last year due to covid and more.
since they have on, they are 24/7 all the time and nothing has touched them or calmed them even slightly.
nothing makes the symptoms better or worse.
is it possible that my head is just in a viscous cycle where it is constantly tense or in fight/flight and it's just stick in this terrible loop causing these symptoms all the time.
i feel as if the anxiety comes from feeling these symptoms but maybe it is causing them and it's a viscous cycle that's just on autopilot subconsciously.
has anyone dealt with this and if so, what has helped you?
what is the best anxiety medication for this?
would benzo's for a short period under care of a psychiatrist help break this cycle?
any help is appreciated..

hello everyone, i'm having a huge stress for about 9 months and it grows bigger everyday and i can't control it.
i'm becoming worse by the time passes, i can't think, remember, focus, relax.
i want to solve this problem but i can't get out of this situation and i'm about to explode.
i have 2 weeks to work on a lot of responsibilities but i don't have any strength in myself anymore.
when i have time in my hands i can't work anything neither i can have fun by doing my favourite activities.
it stops me living in the time, i literally can't do anything because i can't think anymore.
otherwise i don't feel i'm under heavy pressure, i became so numb.
also i'm suspicious of vitamin deficiency.
i want to hear from your experiences, thanks.

i’ve always struggled to fall asleep so i’m wondering if quality sleep will help my stress response and mood?
lmao i've been procrastinating to do my school projects and all i can hear is the notification of my schoolbook for a next project 😀
hey everyone, this is my first post here and i was hoping i could get some advice on how i could go about handling this problem

i experience some symptoms of stress without feeling stressed at all.
i grind my teeth very badly when i sleep, to the point of wearing through several mouthguards and needing a dentist-grade splint to keep my teeth safe.
if anyone could provide any input on how i can lower stress, it would be greatly appreciated
so i've had uncomfortable physiological responses while studying/taking a test for a while now.
things like palpitation, flushed face, etc.
and it was prolonged for the entire semester.
not sure if that counts as significant/chronic emotional stress.
any idea?
hello, i have been posting for nearly 7 months about the same ongoing symptoms and after all my doctors visits, scans, hospital visits, i still don't have an answer.
the symptoms i have are 24/7 and started in october of 2020 after i got my top wisdom teeth removed.
i was not sedated or put to sleep as they were not impacted.
this was also a very very stressful time due to covid, losing my job, being on awful unemployment etc.
since this time i have had 24/7 head pressure felt mainly in the top back of my head.
if i wiggle/lift my ears or raise my eyebrows i feel the pressure originating from this top back crown area but my whole head feels heavy all the time.
nothing makes it worse/better.
along with this comes horrible brain fog and lightheadedness.
i constantly feel spacey/woozy kind of like i'm outside my body or off in gravity.
i have recently noticed that the more active i try to be (when i try to workout) the more spacier and off i feel.
it's not that i'm going to fall but moreso my space in gravity is just off.
my vision is also blurry when looking at a computer screen or tv or just in general, like if i have to fill out papers my vision is blurry and off.
my vision feels like it's constantly spazzing, like nothing is sharp.
i am unable to drive especially when there are many lanes as i feel in a fog and can't accurately pick up a lot of scenery.
i also cannot go into stores because the scenery makes me lightheaded when theirs a lot going on.
i also feel pressure behind my eyes which makes my eyes tired.
my anxiety has been very high from these symptoms and if i start to panic everything gets worse.
i have been having weird anxiety riddled dreams as well as these symptoms have been here 24/7 for nearly 7 months and no doctor has a clue.
i have gotten mri, mra, mrv, ct scan.
i have been to 3 neurologists, 2 ent, emergency room twice etc and nobody has any information on what this is or how to help.
i have tried nearly every over the counter medication and a few prescriptions which don't even knock this 1%, nothing helps at all.
i am currently in the process of going to a chiropractor looking into my atlas to see if their is something functionally off causing this.
i am seeing an atlas orthogonal chiropractor.
i saw a psychiatrist for about 1.5 months and tried lexapro for that amount of time and it didn’t do anything.
if anyone has any idea of what this is or anything that can help it's greatly appreciated.
thanks

i’ve been working through a major life for the last few weeks (breaking up with a life partner - together 12 years and living together 5 of those).
on top of the personal stress of breaking up and moving during covid, my performance at work has been poor.
despite repeated attempts to correct bad behaviors with the support of my company and manager, my performance has not improved and i am experiencing nearly daily mental breakdowns and anxiety/panic attacks.
i am also not able to sleep for more than 3-4 fitful hours a night.
at this stage i strongly believe quitting will be to the benefit of everyone.
i won’t experience the intense stress and anxiety just the thought of logging on to my work station brings and my company can get someone in to do my role with more consistency and success than i.  

i don’t have another job lined up but i am applying to other roles and have a few initial discussions lined up.
am i making the wrong decision in resigning from my current job effective immediately?
for the past 3 days i’ve been so sluggish and tired.
at work my body hurts like hell and it feels longer than it usually does.
i can barely finish my schoolwork which explains my failing grade in math.
i’ve been trying my hardest to get it up.
then at kickboxing i’ve been doing the bare minimum.
my energy just isn’t the same.
i do these things for 6 days a week everyday.
it’s pretty tiring but it’ll be over soon if i keep telling myself to keep going.
finals are in 2 weeks, and my kickboxing season should be over in 8 weeks.
i just need the motivation to keep going.
i’m writing on reddit instead of taking use of my homework time 😭😭.
hello everyone, i've been having anxiety attacks for a year and a month and most of the attacks were happened in last 3 months.
with covid pandemic, we couldn't go outside and a result of this was vitamin d3 deficiency for me.
i am 16 years old, male and i'm aware of what my age brings upon me.
i fought against myself for almost a year, got the blood results and sat very disappointed.
i knew myself very well and i'm not a person who gets affected by emotions so easily.
and i didn't have anything can hit me to ground.
just nothing.
i knew it was a biological thing but with these circumstances i couldn't get any help.
i want to describe myself,my problems and the help i want to have from you.
i'm a very thinking person, have so much opinions, knowledge on many things.
i love philosophy and music.
these two things are my favourite in my life.
sadly, i can't even remember myself, thoughts, artists i love, songs i live with, past i had lived and so on.
i've been having these compliments since february 2020; can't remember things, can't think about anything, can't concentrate, always feeling tired and the list goes on.
long story short, i kinda have a fog on my brain (i thought about this when i was new to these).
i always found a solution for my problems and never disappointed myself but i can't get out of this anymore.
i fought back with this 6 times maybe and i don't have any morale to stand up for one more time.
i can't express myself anymore; my school, relationships, inner peace is getting effected heavily everyday.
i'm losing my abilities, my skills are diminishing, my creativity is fading away.
i can't listen to music anymore, can't find a purpose, can't use my time efficiently anymore.
my vitamin d3 results are on the floor.
the low vitamin limit is 20 mg/l and mine is 5.4 mg/l.
i started taking 3.000 iu daily supplement for almost 2 months and i am a lot better than before but the psychological consequences are still upon me.
i talked with a friend of mine and they said you may have anxiety.
i agree with this, my last few months corrupted by it and depression.
i am not a depression person and know how to fight against but heavy stress from my school is blocking my way out and i feel hopeless.
i'm afraid of losing my thoughts, my mind, my personality, everything i love and care, interest in my hobies.
i read that vitamin d is the background of these diseases.
also i'm having sleep problems for months, this is a factor too.
please enlighten me if you know about this and had experiences.
thanks.
i'm sorry if i used english bad, complicated.
i'm in a very tough situation while writing this, please understand me, i can't even write things in my mind i'm so sorry about this.
i am in a user experience design program and developing an application for stress management to be used by life coaches with their clients.
if you can help me by answering this survey it will really help my project, help me get a job, and also increase my own understanding of stress in my life.
thank you for your time and i hope it is okay to post this here.
i did not see any rules against it.

hi, i’m an indian citizen and as those who keep a tab on world news would know, we’re going through a devastating second wave in india at the moment.
our government is highly incompetent, and is led by people who led pogroms against minorities.
their lack of empathy is our there, where our people (not the the poorest ones but especially them) are dying without oxygen.
our government did not plan in one whole year, and now we have no vacant hospital beds, no icu beds, no ventilators in the national capital and other states.
basics such as oxygen cylinders are a struggle to purchase, and thousands are dying each day, among which a lot of deaths are those that could’ve been avoided.
people are asking for help on twitter and instagram while there is no centralised helpline till now in world’s “largest democracy”.
so, of course, all of this is highly stressful.
one worries not just about their own selves and families, but such a devastating state of affairs takes a toll in a lot of ways.
i can only understand in part what war torn countries go through.
however, i do have the privilege of staying indoors (and help in whatever capacity i can through my social media).
in addition to this, my lover moved countries right before this started happening, so that it also troubling at a personal level.
i am writing here to seek help from all of you on how to cope with this.
i have been struggling with work-life balance and productivity for the longest time.
and at work, i decided to write an article about work-life balance.
i spoke with professionals about their tips and i hope these tips could help you all achieve a healthier work life balance.
[tips to achieve a healthier work life balance ](
every time someone asks me about what is currently stressing me out i get hives and every time i think about the problems i get new tiny rashes.
the rashes are scattered all over my body and they're starting to hurt.
has anyone had this problem before and if so what did you do to resolve it?
any replies are greatly appreciated.
bit of a rant - just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same (excuse the word vomit, i've been up since 6:30 am for an exam).
it's finals week and anxiety/stress is at an all time consistent high.
on top of that, our family puppy has been great but i think my school anxiety has trickled in to me worrying over him more than i should, and i constantly get overwhelmed with all the things i have to get done.
i can't even enjoy food because i am always thinking too much and get caught up in the stress of school.
i literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping, and i immediately said "wow he's depressed isn't he" when he's just sleeping.
i went out to get food, totally fine, no problem.
as soon as i got home it hit me again with all the stuff i have to do.
the pandemic has 1000% affected my mental health especially recently, where i don't get any enjoyment of stuff at home because i am always in front of a damn computer screen.
i used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school, and now i see home as the place where i do everything and there's no distinction between relaxing and school.
but - the one thing i can hold onto is that it is going to pass.
all of this is going to pass at some point, the brain is just rewiring itself because of the situation happening globally.
it's going to be okay, the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time.
if this spoke to anyone out there, feel free to let me know how you're feeling.
how are you coping?
\*\*and if there's any puppy pros in the crowd, please let me know what you did to help release some of that feeling of wanting constantly to helicopter over them during times of stress.
when i feel relieved, i don't feel any need to check on him constantly or obsess over little things around the house, just when i am overwhelmed; and then, i don't get anything productive done anyways.
i always remind myself i am not alone - and neither are you.
even talking to strangers about it can be soothing in a way, just a little reminder that there's someone else out there in your boat during such a difficult time.
my counselor said to normalize what is normal during an abnormal time period.
and also, don't forget to tell your pets you love them.
hey guys, i've started stuttering basically out of the blue a year ago at 22 years of age... i don't really know the cause of it, it could be drugs, medications i take (valium and sulpiride), could also be major traumatic events i've experienced throughout my life..

basically it started as i know one day when i was out with my mom and my sister.
that day i've experienced severe depersonalization and remember when we were talking about something, it was my turn to talk but at the first word of the sentence i startet to repeat the first letter over and over again and just stopped talking.. we were just sitting there silently embarrassed about what had just happened lol..

i do remember a month ago before this event when i was taking speed (amphetamine) i just had a mild stutter at a sentence once a week and didn't think anything of it.. anyways, from that event with my mom and sister i kind of developed a fear of stuttering and started to research stuttering and it just became worse...it kind of became a habit to stutter as always before speaking to anyone i would think of how not to stutter and of course it worked the opposite as you all know..most people don't even know i stutter because i hide it pretty well, i would stop before a stutter and kinda pretend i'm thinking or jus say "umm" and try to find the right word i would not stutter on.. i've also asked my mom if i've ever stuttered as a child, she said that i didn't.. so i think that developemental stuttering is out of the picture.. and also no one in my family had any kind of speech disorder..

i really don't know what to do with this, i'm constantly stressing myself out.. i've said to myself that i would never go to a speech specialist because i would think about my stutter even more, i just try to forget about it.. and it sometimes works when i'm happy or preoccupied with something that i don't have time to think about my speech.. i'm also scared shittless of going to a neurologist because i'm a bit of a hypochondriac lol.. and the fact that i've started to forget things, words, sometimes i can't understand a sentence and have to read it 10 times to even try to understand it, but it happens very rarely.. all of rhis could be because of the medication or sever stress.. i really don't know.. so basically i'm asking you guys if you ever had a similar experience, or if you know anyone who experienced something like this.. it could also be that i'm so fucked up mentally that i've just imagined my stutter and the fear of it keeps it alive lol
so i'm really not a depressed person at all, probably more the opposite, but when i am in a really stressful situation at work (especially when i mess something up) i honestly feel like killing myself.
i wouldn't do it because i have a wife and kids, but can anyone relate to this feeling?
it's especially strong when i feel like i'm not good at my job.
hi all, i hope you are well.
i had a crazy amount of stress/trauma last year convincing myself i had cancer.
this chronic stress lasted from april 2020 until january 2021.

i now have crazy nausea everyday and my digestion is all over the place.
can stress have such an impact?
alright, so let me get this straight.
i often find myself getting overwhelmed by the least amount of homework and i’m only in grade 12. for example, i get 2 sheets of homework and i often find myself breaking down and just giving up, even though i never felt like this before.
i just get overwhelmed break down for no apparent reason.
even when i’m free, i don’t really feel free.
what is going on, does anybody know or can help me?
anyone get sometimes heart flutters ?
i always get worried .
but have been checked out by cardiologists

i am a healthcare worker and i only moved to my current city last year.
i don't have many friends here aside from work friends and a couple friends i met through my boyfriend.
lately, i have felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety and stress.
it seems like everyone around me does not care anymore that there is a pandemic going on.
with this back and forth of restrictions and uncertainties, many people seem to just be so sick of it and have started to ignore the restrictions and hanging out as normal.
working in healthcare, especially as a frontline worker, i have a hard time doing that.
i certainly don't want to be the person to be a super spreader since i work at multiple sites.
they typically have gatherings that involve drinking and ending up indoors.
i feel like such a prude for wanting to follow the guidelines and just have outdoor gatherings so i don't end up going.
i wish i had some friends who are still taking precautions.
i understand that it seems like the light at the end of the tunnel seems to be just a glimmer these days but if people stop caring now, won't that just drag things out??
it's not fair that this just prolongs the suffering for those who are actually being careful.
feeling overwhelmingly alone in this lately.

(background; my actual car is a manual and it got reversed into the other day so driving an automatic hire car)

last night i was driving with my girlfriend back to her house and i felt a bit sick in the stomach and was just sitting in silence, i was in my own world stressing about my car and life in general - i was driving at about 80-90km/h and for the first time ever i mistakenly thought i was still in my own car and as something went into my eye i went to downshift so i could keep a bit of control and speed whilst i fix my eye and i hit the break with my left foot.
in the 1 second it took to process everything and think about everything that was going on and as i was going to take my foot off the break the car that was behind me smashed into us and caused a 4 car accident.
yes, it was a very honest mistake, it was the first time it’s ever happened and i thank god no one was seriously hurt.
the car behind me seemed too close but i just can’t help being depressed about the whole situation; if i would’ve stopped at a service station earlier or been in a different lane would it still have happened?
am i the one at fault because i made that small mistake?
why did it have to happen when my girlfriend was in the car with me?
just why?
i feel like everyone has the right to push me down and say i’m in the wrong and i feel everyone should criticise me and make me feel like the piece of trash i am.
people keep saying accidents happen and sometimes god puts us through things we don’t understand and that they’ve done the same thing too when driving an automatic but i can’t help but feel like they’re just taking pity on me and don’t want me to feel bad when i should.
tldr; was the front car in an accident and i don’t think i’m at fault but can’t help but feel like i am.
just need some help on how to stop stressing and feeling like this.
anyone heart ever like “jiggle “ or gets super high from drinking coffee ?
as posted a few nights ago i woke up middle night having a panic attack .
can panic attacks last hours ?
lasted from 12-3:30 .
had to take more xanax than i usually do .
heart was racing whole time
i guess this is a vent of sorts.
i just feel the need to express just how stressed out i get the day before my next shift starts.
it’s early a.m.
and i should have been asleep hours ago but i’m stressing.
i’d quit this job in a minute if i had another one to go to but given the pandemic and other roadblocks, that possibility is is pretty small.
i want more than anything to move back home but i’m stuck and that only adds to the stress.
[
i have an amazing memory and can think on my feet in most situations.
until i'm late for something (appointment, meet a friend, a date once).
then i don't remember anything.
i'll even go the wrong directions out of habit and not catch it for 10 or even 20 minutes.
occasionally when people are mad at me i'll often not remember anything, like if a problem happens i don't even remember that i took steps to avoid it and think it's completely my fault when it was an accident or someone elses mistakes, even when i mention those steps in writing.
i hate not being able to remember things when i'm stressed.
i sometimes won't even remember facts until a day or two later if it was stressful enough.
is there something i can do?


as the earth rotates daily on its axis, every morning the sun brings light to the darkness, warmth and comfort to the chill of night, photo synthesis to plants, and security to humans.
it's for this reason that as far back as 14,000 8.c.e., adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cave walls.
countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient egypt and mesopotamia, the mayans and the aztecs, and the australian aborigines, to name just a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source of enlightenment, illumination, and wisdom.
while the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on earth because the earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields.
on a grand scale, it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between the sun's energy, the earth's energy, and the energy of all living species.
on a micro level, all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit or vegetable to understand this interdependence.
consciously absorbing that energy to combine with your own spiritual energy has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more.
your spiritual energy goes under many different names like spiritual chills, euphoria, voluntary goosebumps, ecstasy, prana, chi, qi, vayus, aura, mana, life force, pitī, rapture, ruah, ether, nephesch, chills, frissons, the force and many more.
here's a 3 minute [youtube video]( expanding more on the benefits and how to, actually absorb the energy from the sun, through your own self-induced voluntary goosebumps from positive events/thoughts/memories/feelings.
**no, it is not a tumour, i have had mris, eegs etc.
**

so essentially, i struggle to find the words that i want to say.
i often stutter, and repeat a few words like 2-3 times every now and then.
this is over the last few years (currently 23).
i find there are days where my head is completely clear, and i feel like my head is clear of all clutter and can find every word i want to say.
looking back on these days, i find that i have been surrounded by people i love and am comfortable with.
where i feel accepted.
so i do not struggle to say things and can speak freely.
the next day i tend to feel amazing and can speak freely as well.
the following days, it reverts back to the same tension and struggle to find words.
it would appear that it might be related to me not feeling accepted anywhere?
or not feeling confident?
i am hoping someone has experienced this and knows of any exercises that can relieve this tension and allow me to think and speak freely.
(i eat well, meditate, exercise, have a lovely family, lovely relationship, i do see a neurologist for other reasons and yes i am aware that this could be related but i want to explore simple stress techniques as well, so please please please if you can, just provided some exercises that may help)

thank you guys so much.
hey reddit.
i have a stupid idea but i might go for it.
i'm gonna offer my ex money.
i can afford it, and maybe it could help him in his situation.
because of his situation, he is considering suicide - at least if you can trust his latest post on this page.
we just broke up and it was a bad breakup.
i decided i would cut him off completely and not reply no matter what.
he did some efforts to reach me and i ignored him for 3 days.
last night he messaged me saying that i could talk to him if i needed to, and i replied today (because of my intentions.)
i decided to drop my ego but i'm stressed out waiting for a reply because my gut feeling says that he won't reply, as a payback.
now i don't even know if  his suicide plan is real but it worries me a lot.
it could be a dirty trick to get my attention or he just meant to say goodbye for the last time.
i don't know for real, that also stresses me out.
thinking about him makes me feel extremly bad.
contacting him feels completely wrong, but the reason i even wanna give him these money is because i care about him, i did promise to help him out and also that i want to be a good person that keeps her promises.
hi reddit, i have come to a point where my brain is full of negative self talk.
i feel stressed and anxious towards life.
im 18 and in 2 months i have a huge and very difficult exam that seems to be "defining my life from now on".
i feel like im doing everything wrong and i cant find peace.
i still dont know what do to with my life and recently i have gone through some very scary life events...had a very very bad pregnancy scare, got sick, my family has covid, i had bad grades and my mom also wants to get away and live alone...which i agree with her 

i just feel like im getting shot from multiple directions at the same time and i dont know how to handle my life anymore.
i keep focusing on what i did wrong and i cant stop thinking about it and procastinating  punishing myself for every wrong step.
i need advice.
thank you for reading this far, have a great day.
 

overthinking kills both externally and internally , don't think too much .

my heart rate been 120 i think i’m having a bad bout of anxiety .
how long does your high heart rate last for ?
mine has been hours

also whenever i move or turn it races
work is such a huge stress in my life.
i am a recent cancer survivor (2017) and work is still worse.
why do i care so much?
my very kind boss gave me two days off and i still can not turn off my brain.
i am looking for a new position.
i have to fin something better.
🙏
got checked by so many cardiologist.
i had one drink 4 hours ago but my heart has been racing all night i took xanax which usually calms it down but i didn’t .
idk what to do

edit : usually .5 of my xanax would help me but i had to take 2 and 1/2 of them within a couple hours to relax .
if you are really anxious does it take more xanax to help you calm down ?
hi everyone, for the last few weeks i’ve been feeling very off:

i feel like i’m living in a dream, like almost drunk but not quite drunk.
like i’m disconnected and out of it.
i feel like i’m living behind a glass, no quite “in my life”

i’ve been having pressure around the back of my neck, the back of my head, (not a headache just pressure) and i sometimes feel like my eyes are being pushed too.
i had blood work done, and everything seems fine, i had a negative covid test twice, antibody test for covid came out negative... checked for lyme disease, heavy metals, and other common things but everything keeps coming back negative.
at this point i’m wondering if this is related to anxiety/stress.
in the last year, like most of us i’m sure, i’ve been dealing with lots of emotional ups and downs, i suffered from my first panicked attack las summer but things improved a bit after that so didn’t have to take any medication or continue with a therapist.
my logical brain wants to tell me that symptoms like the described above are no way related to anxiety disorders or chronic stress but i’m desperate to understand what’s happening to me.
could you please share if you have ever felt this way and your experiences or knowledge?
i’m waiting for another doctors appointment on monday but for the meantime i’m trying to calm down because at this point i’m thinking it could be something seriously wrong with my brain (like a tumor or infection)

thanks so much for you help!
o k the title is long but how should i help with my stress it might also be being fully remote or the fact i haven’t been getting good grades or maybe it’s when i have to hike and on the way i have to listen to music i don’t like for a few hours straight ok i’m being dramatic it’s not big of a deal it’s just headaches from loud music i don’t like and bad grades.
and feeling guilty for things that aren’t my fault do any of you know why that is?
i recently got covid and while i recovered, along with the stress from work, i realized that i can’t seem to find a healthy way of managing stress, making the continuous build up turn into anxiety attacks.
along with all the above i’m also trying to quit smoking and my bad stress management seems to make things harder in that department too.
can you provide me with some tips in order to build a healthy relationship with my stress and anxiety?
will a hobby like drawing help in that situation?
hi everyone!
here's a guided [video]( of a stress-relieving meditation called alternate nostril breathing for anyone who's interested.
the instructor is a german doctor who got certified to teach yoga in nepal and figured we'd make a video.
hope you enjoy :)
for some reason for last night and tonight going to sleep has had me very anxious.
i literally cried both nights.
it is currently 2:51am and i have school.

if you can help with this problem i would be super happy for your help.

i feel like my mind is actually breaking.
i feel like i can feel literal cracks on my brain.
it's painful.
constant headache.
stiffness in the neck.
hard to speak.
hard to think.
my job is completely stressful.
when i'm there i'm constantly looking at my computer screen doing work.
if not one thing then 3 different things at once.
i don't take breaks outside of lunch.
i feel like everyone at my office hates me.
they think i'm "boring".
no.
i'm just the only one in the office who doesn't have anyone friends, relationships, or fun outside of the office.
i don't have a lot of fun and exciting experiences in life so i literally have nothing to talk about.
i"m judged negatively for this everyday.
i beat me self up for this everyday.
its like i'm being jumped by a bunch of bullies and i'm the worst one.
support doesn't exist.
i live with people i don't talk to at all.
no love.
i'm unattractive to everyone.
i feel like people are just mannequins waiting to tell me that i need to do more or i haven't done enough....they want me to go out and experience things they don't want to be a part of.
it's like if you don't want to be a part of my life then don't "help" me.
you are a person too.
i'm looking at you too.
i'm trying to talk to you too.
i'm trying to build a relationship with you too.
everyone acts like you.
everyone wants to "help" me like you.
everyone wants to push me away like you.
none of you are different.
that's why i don't talk.
no one is different.
no one wants to build anything with me.
everyone expects my life to already be built so i can entertain them from a distance.
i want love.
i want friends.
i want a girlfriend.
i want to have fun times with people who want to have fun times with me.
life's not worth living otherwise.

anyone get high heart rate , sharp chest pains , ear ringing ?
from being anxious ?
hello,

i am conducting a survey as part of my degree in psychology at the university of derby to evaluate the impact of green spaces on mental health.
specifically, this study aims at analysing the effect of the number of visits, awareness levels while in green spaces and the type of greenspace visited on stress levels.
accordingly, i am seeking your participation in the study.
the survey is expected to take about 5 minutes.
it will present certain questions about your visits to greenspaces over the last month and some other questions related to your general stress levels during that period.
your participation will be a valuable addition to our research and findings and could lead to a better understanding of the impact of green spaces on mental health.
here's the link to the survey: [
lo-fi study (relaxing beats in lo-fi scale)- [

childish gambino playlist- [

frank ocean playlist- [

powerful female vocals (female acoustic and pop with powerhouse voices)- [

blonded radio (alternative rnb and relaxation music)- [

house music for you ravers!- [
i'm not a newbie, i've been at this company for more than three years so i know what my job is.
but for the past couple of months i've been anxious at the start of my shift and as i progress (by midday) i feel stress on my right shoulder or trap.
this always happens daily and i feel that i'm not the most stressed only when its my rest day.
so i tend to get more done during those days compared to my normal days on shift.
hoping that folks could share insights or help me out with techniques to improve when i am on shift.
thank you.
hello everyone i'm psychology student in amsterdam and we need a lot of participants being university students between 18-25 years old.

hey everyone hope you’re doing ok.
i’m so stressed right now, i had college assignments and let them stack up because i kept thinking “i’ll do it later!” now i have two months or less to complete 5 assignments.
i thought i had one almost done but i lost the file and i realised i needed to redraw it to add more stuff.
i know what i need to do but don’t know how to start them, especially the essays.
i feel so stupid.
my mum said i should tell the teachers about my mental health problems and i think they would help but i’m ashamed.
i feel like the most unorganised person in the class and don’t want them to think i’m just coming out with excuses for being lazy or something.
i’m panicking and can’t think straight.
it’s like 10 at night right now and i’m exhausted and have college tomorrow but feel like i need to do everything right now.
can anyone please help me
i'm in college which is being held online.
i'm living with family.
for some reason, the admins decided to not give a spring break this semester (so we have no breaks), and cut the semester shorter by a week.
we're in the final weeks, and since the length is a week shorter, the professors are cramming 2 weeks worth of material in one.
it's been very stressful, since these topics are harder, and there have been more projects.
i haven't been able to swallow food for a while now.
i feel hungry, but when i try to swallow, i basically dry heave or even throw up if i swallow.
i've been to a hospital and done tests, and they didn't find any abnormalities with my body, so i'm assuming this is caused by stress.
this has never happened before, and i have lost a lot of weight because of this.
i only eat about 1 meal a day (eat a little for each meal).
i only have 2 weeks + 1 week of finals left, but i honestly feel like i can't focus on studying anymore.
whenever i try to do homework, i end up sitting there for hours, making only a little progress.
anti-anxiety medication isn't available in my country, and my parents don't believe in them anyway.
i really don't know any other solution.
any advice?

mental health matters and tips to live healthier!

does anyone get sharp gas pains in their chest ?
i’m assuming that’s what it is i’ve been eating healthier and a lot of veggies .
got a full heart check up because my anxiety makes me think something is wrong .
but now whenever i gets pain in my chest i freak out
i have immersed myself into my career at the company i have been working with for 5 years this march.
i am in my mid 20's and in a position that everyone said i couldn't do when i was promoted.
the first 3 months were rough, but i learned from my mistakes and got comfortable and do my job well.
&amp;#x200b;

the first year and a half in management i was always stressed, but i was not as overwhelmed as i am now, and i seemed to enjoy myself outside of work more.
i got to a point around the 2 year mark in management where i was super comfortable where i was and was working regular hours (45 hours a week or so).
when coronavirus hit, it was like our workflow increased, with less people to work, and more demand on us as managers.
i went through one of the hardest summers working with minimal help, doing more projects then ever.
follow this by hurricane sally, worked 60+ hours for a few weeks, customers constantly not being understanding of the situation and only making me feel like i was failing them, to no fault of my own.
the next few months my workload seemed to grow exponentially, but i was unable to focus and keep up with where i know i need to be.
i eventually go to the doctor and test for adhd and get prescribed adderall.
( i should add i was already taking adderall at times for a month or two prior because i could not focus at work whatsoever).
the adderall helped me more then i could've hoped, i was now as high functioning as i used to be and was knocking work out.
it has leveled out some now and i feel normal on it now but still get positive results out of it.
&amp;#x200b;

now i am in the same boat as last spring, 40% of employees i need to keep up with workflow, certain material is hard to come by or non existent, constant weather issues, and customers just keep approving work.
i am working almost always 7 days a week.
i'm up by 445 and wont get home until 5 or 6 on average but i have a few days every week  i work till 7 or 8 to finish a job or get material.
i now even spent my money to setup an office at home so i could work in my free time just to try and catch up.
we are working skeleton crews, and seems there is no end in sight to the labor shortage.
a lot of the responsibilities i feel so overwhelmed and stressed by are ones i have taken on myself, because no one else was.
i have an ownership mentality and treat this business as it was my own.
&amp;#x200b;

now that's the work part of it....

i had an almost 5 year relationship with the girl i was in love with, that ended in me heartbroken and afraid to trust any one.
i kept to myself but talked to a few women here and there.
i found one, that i had any real connection with, and that ended as a failed relationship.
i fell more in love with this woman then i ever felt with my previous girlfriend, and was in a dark place when she left.
follow this by months of me feeling like i wasn't enough and no one i wanted, wanted me.
i have a handful of good friends, and a couple that are one of a kind.
but i always feel like i am bothering them, or just there to be there but i know this is me overthinking and all that.
i also rented a house with my "best friend" that has turned into a nightmare.
can't say anything without him getting defensive, no help around the yard or house, constantly taking advantage of me being nice.
he was also working with me and turned into a bum and was missing work constantly and always so negative to be around.
so add all that stress at work and come home to a house you hate the other person there and have to dread being home until he moves out.
the past two months have been the hardest i've ever dealt with mentally and physically.
i'm working 10-12 hours a day and coming home and putting proposals or schedules together.
i feel like i cant take a day off, much less a whole weekend.
its like we are batting against the odds and something goes wrong every week.
but we are also doing great and revenue out the wazoo.
all while working salary and not being compensated for the overtime.
i feel like im about to explode.
every day i feel like i'm about to have a meltdown and crash mentally.
my mental health seems to have  its days.
some are great, some are just days, and some days i just want to stop.
&amp;#x200b;

how can i cope with all this stress that i take on myself and cant leave "at work".
i have three health problems that are all triggered or worsened by stress.
and predictably i have severe anxiety and basically everything stresses me out.
i have a high stress job, and three kids (2 of which have complicated health problems).
when reading about helping my health problems the literature always says reduce stress... but how?
how do i just stop stressing when it’s my first reaction all of the time?
i am 20 and trying to move out when i get the money.
i live with my mum and my younger sister who's 16. they dont tidy up after themselves and i consider myself someone who has to have things tidy to feel normal.
its got to the point where every single time i go downstairs its a mess and i either end up shouting and getting angry or crying.
i cant cope with having to constantly clean up after them and i know if i just stop itll build up and be messy.
nobody helps me.
just needed to vent because idk what advice to receive.
i'm sorry if my formatting isn't great, i'm writing this on a mobile.
i came home from food shopping around two hours ago and after a short period of time noticed that my dog, claude had chewed through the blind in the living room.
he hasn't been destructive in the short amount of time i've had him so it really threw me.
it may not seem like much, but i saved for a little while to get the blind and when i saw it i just broke down into sobs.
this isn't supposed to be a 'woe is me' post but something so small has sent me into a tailspin.
whenever i get stressed or something bad happens, (usually relating to money) my go to emotion is abject negativity.
not intentionally but all i saw is black and something minor can ruin my mood for the whole day, sometimes even days at a time.
i don't have any other coping mechanisms other than to completely shut down.
claude is a new addition to my home after i lost my two previous pups only three months apart.
i know he hasn't done it to upset me, dogs don't think or act that way but it hasn't stopped me from crying.
money is always so tight here and i just didn't need this right now.
so i'm writing my final assignment for uni after 4 years.
it's due in 2 days and i have 5000 words left to write.
i was diagnosed with covid just over 2 weeks ago which has left me really behind.
i'm still suffering with brain fog and anxiety from covid and i am finding this an impossible task.
i'm not someone who quits but i genuinely dont know how i will do this.
i cant concentrate at all on the paper and i dont know how i can keep going with it.
not sure why i'm writing this.
i guess i just need to have a moment to panic and stress.


it can pass through anything because it basically is the same frequency type that a radio transmitter puts out.
the frequency that you're transmitting from your brain is smaller, but, it has a unique characteristic, unlike radio frequencies.
which is that the frequency that your brain transmits can instantaneously travel faster than the speed of light and if transmitted can be picked up the exact same moment by another human brain on the opposite end of the planet.
(energy and frequency are the same.)
everything on planet earth emits a different frequency.
a frequency is also called a vibration.
it's also called energy.
it is quantifiable and it is measurable.
every atom emits a frequency.
your dna at the lowest level emits a unique frequency.
so your brain is a receiver and a transmitter a frequency.
that's the first concept and the second concept is the law of attraction.
which says, whatever frequency you emit, that exact same frequency is drawn to you.
there will be a magnetic pull.
and this is a scriptural principle.
for those of you who are christians, jewish, muslims, hindus or buddhists.
all these books teach very similar concepts.
what you sow, also you reap.
when you put out a frequency the law of attraction says it must come back.
law of attraction says by magnetic pull that has to bring that exact same frequency back.
which is based on whatever vibration you put out whatever frequency that your brain, emotions, body and electromagnetic field puts out.
it will attract and it will defy any physical law.
self-induced goosebumps, from positive stimulis, allows you to take 100% control of your transmitter by vibrating different parts of your body, and is also able to, as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot) vibrate your whole physical body.
when doing so, you consciously activate your physical and spiritual body to attract whatever intention, narrative, thought and emotions that are present when
consciously summoning your self-induced goosebumps.
goosebumps is just the physical reaction, but underneath it, theres a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as energy.
i've found many names for this energy like spiritual chills, euphoria, voluntary goosebumps, ecstasy, prana, chi, qi, vayus, aura, mana, life force, pitī, rapture, ruah, ether, nephesch, chills, frissons, the force and many more.
if you would like to know how to activate at will, fully control your spiritual chills and how its an important ingredient to the law of attraction, here's a five minute video explaining just that.
