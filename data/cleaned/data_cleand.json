        "0":"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at \/r\/depression\/wiki\/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the \/r\/depression and \/r\/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt\/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",
        "1":"Welcome to \/r\/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nWe try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under \"Community Info\" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.  \n\n********\n\n**Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.**  \n\nIt's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  *Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.*\n\n*****\n\n**Despite the fact that we always maintain a sticky post about it, we're still seeing a lot of violations of the private contact policy.  Please read \/r\/depression\/wiki\/private_contact and report any violations that you see.**  Widespread disregard of this important rule causes trouble for both helpers and vulnerable OPs, wastes our time, and delays the improvements we're making to the community resources.",

        "4":"I was at school yesterday and started having a panic attack because I was remember what BAS did to me and sometimes it feels like I can feel it happening all over again. I wasn't really able to handle it so I decided to go to the counselors office. It took me a while but eventually I was able to tell them I was sexually assaulted. It was really hard to get the words to form in my mouth, it felt wrong but I managed. I knew they'd tell my parents and the police. I talked to an officer at my school and told him a bit about it, I refused to say what exactly happened and I also refused to give them their names. They called my mom and told her, I really just felt numb the whole time. I have to go to an interview with some other police officer, they want me to tell them what exactly happened but I dont know that I can..\nMy mom told my grandma when I got home and I didn't feel anything. I didn't say it so it wasn't that bad. I can see how they look at me differently, the sorrow in their eyes. If I focus on it it hurts so I just tried to avoid eye contact. I don't know, it won't leave my head even more than usual. I feel awful and distant. I dont know. I figured people would want an update so yea, here you go. Any advice or anything would be appreciated. Thank you for reading this far and I hope you have a nice rest of you day\/evening",

        "6":"So i found a method of escaping anxiety . I don't know if it's healthy or not but i started sleeping 12-15 hrs a day. \nIt's better to sleep than to think about the problems i guess.",
        "7":"I noticed frequently when I watch videos that involve death that people always mention that death was that persons destiny. For instance I watch spiritual videos sometimes and they will say a spirit communicated that the timing was right. Directly after they say \u201cexcept for cases of suicide\u201d. Sorry but that makes no sense. If you have an urge to go driving and accidentally get in a car crash and die how is that different from the urge to go driving and crash because you purposely wanted to end your life? I personally don\u2019t think it makes any sense that suicide death would be any different from anything else. I\u2019m just a religious person trying to understand why things happen and I don\u2019t see why suicide would be someone abandoning their destiny. If everyone has a set path , then they won\u2019t leave that path.",
        "8":"Just a random thought I just had, really. I probably have depression, and I really really hate myself. But I also find myself fantasizing about having a girlfriend more and more, like, I'm starting to actively WANT to be in a relationship.\n\nBut the thing is, I also tried to follow the rule of \" loving yourself before you try to love someone else \" for a long time. And yeah, how could I actually love someone if I don't like myself ?\n\nI don't know. It's like I am not even sure what it is I truly want. Do I :\nA : Actually want someone to love \nor B : Do I just want to stop feeling lonely ? Do I just want to use a person to fill a void in my life ?\n\nAs much as I would love to believe it's the first option, the truth is it's probably the second one. And it makes me feel like such a scumbag, wanting to use people. And I hate myself even more.\n\nBut even if I know all this, at the end of the day, the desire of wanting a girlfriend is still here. So yeah. It's a vicious circle.\n\nTo some extent, it even applies to my friends, are my feelings of love and admiration for them genuine ? Or do I just like the fact that being with them is the only thing that makes me happy ?\n\nHow can you be so fucked up you don't even know how you, yourself feel about things anymore ?",

I don\u2019t really feel like I belong anywhere, with anyone, and I feel like I just bring misery along with me wherever I go. I\u2019ve felt sad for as long as I can remember and there was a lot of problems at home when I was younger which probably didn\u2019t help.\nI don\u2019t like feeling like this and I wish it would go away. Sometimes feels like I\u2019m detached from the rest of the world and I\u2019m just looking in at it from a glass window.

        "18":"Long, dramatic read about my life ahead of you. Also wrote this on mobile so sorry for the format and mistakes \n\nNote: I posted this on r\/suicidewatch just now as well, and figured that this would probably be a community that would resonate with some of what I said here too.\n\n\nI'm tired of living my life. I feel like I've tried so many different times to change who I am. To catch up. To be a person who can speak coherently. To be a person who can be interested in things and put effort into them. To be a person who takes care of themselves. To be a person at all really. Haven't gotten anywhere in what feels years.\n\nFor context, I used to be pretty happy and on a good track when I was really young (4-10 years old). I had good friends, did well in school etc, but then I had to be fucking stupid and prioritize video games\/internet over everything else. I started pretending I was sick and did everything I could during 5th grade to stay home and be on my computer, and for some reason, be it anxiety or charitablility\/empathy, my mom played into it and let me do it. Eventually, It got out of control and there was a period where I got pneumonia and lobbied my parents to let me stay home for weeks which put me in a shitty position with the school I was going to. But that's okay! My mom has a solution. Online homeschool.\n\nI think online homeschool can be done well and I don't think my mom was malicious. I truly and honestly think she wanted the best for me, but fuck me this was this not the way to go. I stayed at home every day all year round while, submerged my self in all sorts of media and, on a more positive note, did good with the little amount of school work I had to do. but most importantly I isolated myself in my room, and didn't talk to anyone for large periods of times, not even people online. I feel like this messed with my psyche a lot. I mean, imagine next to no experiences (in the form of personal ones, not learned ones) from the ages of 11-14. Maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it is, but either way, that period of my life has shaped me into the absolutely worthless fucking human being I am now. \n\nI've tried going back to school in person multiple times in middle school, and now highschool, and It's not worked out too well. I just can't effectively communicate ideas talking to people, and I struggle a lot with figuring out what people mean in writing and when they're speaking to me. I'm overall really stupid and lazy because of the lack of challenge I've had throughout my entire, even before I went to online homeschool, but I've gotten really good at gaming academics and speak in stilted language so a lot of people at my school and my age in general think I'm smart, in that sort of stereotypically autistic way. It's cringe, I'm cringe and so many of my interactions as result are very awkward. I genuinely hate myself too, I mean really hate myself, and it's done me 0 favors since now I have a much more negative identity which makes me want to be a edgelord. And usually I temper myself, but it's become much more difficult in the past year due to being right back in the same situation I was before in online school with covid and all, and of course that's caused my mental health to decline drastically. Leading me to the present actually.\n\nIf you haven't noticed too, there are a lot of details I've been leaving out and gaps in my recantation, and it's due to a lot of factors, but primarily depression and ???????. I have this sort of bizarre pesudo-state way of describing what happens in my mind, and it makes formulating what I feel into words fairly difficult, since if I stated it the way I usually think about it would soubd very strange and like I was talking about some sort of fantasy government, which it is. The other major reason is because my memory and ability to recall events has been damaged by depression and anxiety, which I've struggled with for years along all the other bullshit I've managed to do to myself. Point of all this being that this might all seem strange. (I'm not autistic by the way). Anyway on to the part that makes this post appropriate for the subreddit.\n\nI'm 16 years old right now, and I'm going to kill myself tonight because I'm tired of the things I put myself through, and my repeated inability to deal with them. My parents are going away, and I have everything I need to pass peacefully and cleanly. I love my parents, but I don't want them to see me when I eventually become the deadbeat dipshit that I feel like I'm doomed to become if I keep living. I'm sorry for what they'll go through and I'm sorry for everyone I'll hurt. But this cannot go on anymore. I'll be here for a few hours after I post this, and then I'm attempting.",
        "19":"You guys are strong, all of you, even if you don't think you are. No matter how much this disease beats you down and strips you clean, you somehow get back up and struggle onwards. Is it for the people you love? The future that might be filled with bright skies? The simple concept that you can get better here and now?\n\nI'm fearing that my time's up once again. I've just found myself sliding back into terrible levels of apathy and agony, finding it harder to enjoy the simple things in life and near impossible to attend classes or take basic care for myself. I don't have the strength to kill myself or the strength to heal and move on; so here I am, just waiting and rotting. I dream sometimes, that I have a way out of this mess and can make my way in life.

I don't if this was a manic episode or something else I know that nobody could possibly suffers more than me. I wouldn't wish even to my worst enemy to go through such a thing. \n\nThe last six months there is not a day I stay home eventhough I wanted so much. Everyday I walk for miles, I sit alone on dirty benches with only company stray dogs, I drink the same coffee which I hate it and then I spent every night until very late in my mom's car. I have forgotten to eat like a normal person in my house because I eat the same crap food in the car everyday. I barely bathe myself and I used to wear the same 4 5 clothes everyday. My glasses have problem and I can't see well, my shoes are scratched, I have multiple problems with my back, sometimes I was sure I would fade out but I don't care. Every night is a living nightmare, I sweat constantly and go to the bathroom at least 30 times because I have irritable bowel and I keep neglect medical help. I also suspect that I have a rare syndrome due to my extensive use of cortisol but again I don't do anything about it. \n\nI don't know really why I treat myself this way. I used to think that my ocd is responsible for all of these rituals because everytime I'm afraid that something bad is gonna happen if I don't do certain things but recently as lockdown stopped I was able to stop many of my rituals quite easily. My family was always kind of dysfunctional but through  r\/raisedbynarcissists and some articles I realized how much damaged they did to me and I truly believe that my cruel self punishment comes from here. \n\nI can't believe how many months have passed and I'm still like that. I didn't understand that  Christmas or Easter or my birthday have passed because everyday is the same. I look my  books, my drawings and cry because I want so much to start over again. I want to clean my room, my clothes, to spent a quiet evening with reading and music. I want to write something, to sleep and take care of myself. I want to be healthy again, stop eating crap food and not be obese anymore. I have lost so many opportunities, some classes I wanted to attend, movies i wanted to watch, things I wanted to buy. My life never was good but this sick situation is a whole new level. \n\nI feel so tired. My body hurts but my soul is totally damaged. Every night I spend 2 3 hours in balcony thinking to jumb. I waste my time scrolling here reading other people's stories who feel proud of themselves over the tiniest achievements and I can't understand why I punish myself when I have prove in the past that I'm capable to handle very difficult situations. Why I have the need from others to tell me how strong I am? \n\nI'm sorry for my rambling I know that nobody is gonna answer me either way, I just want to share my suffering because I don't have anyone to support me. I can't find a way to start again my life I don't have energy anymore to try and I know that sooner or later I will end up worst. I don't want to die but I can't find other solution. I can't stand anymore the pain I feel when I know that my own mother who I used to believe that she loves me and cares about me she still judge me, neglect me and every moment she don't forget to remind me what a burden I'm and how much I tired her. Of course this is not excuse to become violent towards her but I still do it out of anger and I hit myself also many times. \n\nIt's such a shame because I really had dreams and ambitions but I'm tired being to nice with people and all I got all these years from everyone is rejection. How to love yourself when literally everybody whole my life classmates, teachers, therapists, friends, parents, strangers treated me like a garbage and invalidated me? The only good thing I can do for myself is to get rid of me as soon as possible. \n\nPs. The last two weeks things changed a lot and I had to adjust my toxic routine because lockdown was over. I managed to stop some of my compulsions but I still can't find a way to help myself. I go out with my mom for shopping, to a caf\u00e9 etc. and she pretents like nothing happened all these months. I walked on the crowed streets and I feel lost, my social anxiety is getting out of control again and I feel suffocated.

I don\u2019t remember the last time I was able to just breathe.\n\nWhat sucks is I\u2019m not really worrying about myself. It\u2019s my older brother. He struggles in school a lot and I\u2019m just so terrified of the future. My mind is constantly filled with \u201cis he going to be okay\u201d \u201cis he going to go to college\u201d \u201cwill he become homeless and poor\u201d and it\u2019s driving me insane. This has been going on for so long that I don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like to not feel this way. I\u2019ve lashed out on my family due to the stress of it all. I\u2019ve feel like I\u2019m becoming a menace to my own family. I know how I\u2019m feeling now is stressing my mom and dad out too. And no matter what they say, I don\u2019t get any better. I just cry and I hate it.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s no way to help me. I\u2019m just broken. Honest to God, I\u2019ve tried so so hard to feel myself. But it\u2019s all temporary distractions. Doomed to feel this way until I see with my own eyes my older brother become a functioning adult. And I feel like it\u2019s slowly eating away at me. I just want to stop feeling horrible. I want everything to just be okay.",
        "60":"I\u2019ve known this for quite some time but I have to remind myself more often than not. I have no family, no friends, no one to love because heck why lower your standards to be with me? I\u2019ve been bullied most of my life by my family, \u2018friends\u2019. I\u2019ve always been the punchline of everyone\u2019s joke at the dinner table and at the school canteen. I was molested by my cousin, punched by my male neighbour, had a heavy dictionary thrown at me. Been choked by my sister, sat on by my other sister. I\u2019ve been spat on by my mum twice, threatened by my older brothers. Been told many times that I don\u2019t matter, that I\u2019m not normal; no one has ever defended me. And I really believe them, I really don\u2019t like me. I hate me. I ask God why did you make me? What a waste of a human life, I will gladly give my soul to a miscarried baby or someone\u2019s sweet grandma who passed away. If I could, I\u2019ll let them live instead of me. I don\u2019t want to kill myself but I don\u2019t want to exist, I want to fade away. 11th of February 1998 should mean nothing to everybody. I\u2019m really sorry that you had to read this, as I\u2019m crying but my whole life, I\u2019ve either been neglected or abused. No one in my family seems to think so, that\u2019s okay why should they even care about a non-person like myself. \n\n\n(I\u2019m all emotional because my cat is unwell, he\u2019s gone blind and everyone in the house is blaming me)",

Got rid of social anxiety and normal anxiety, made friends, improved my grade to a 3.9 gpa in Uni and am now graduating. Didn't fix the depression and now I just have more stuff to get depressed over.\n\nRecently, got rejected from a program that would have me work over seas. I asked my best friend out a couple months ago, got rejected. Became much better friends after that though. later, found out she has a thing for an old hs friend that lives out of state, and a vacation we planned together was in large part so she can hook up with this friend. So, I'm no longer going to do that trip.\n\nI have a lot of other stuff going on, but those are some things I had hope for recently. This year I gave myself a hard deadline for when I would finally end it, created a plan, everything. Decided to do it after graduation, so a couple weeks from now. Unfortunately tho, my friend convinced me to stick around for a while (I opened up to her about my depression after we started getting really close. Asshole thing to do, I know). Now I can't even connect to that suicidal part of me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Planned on ending things, finally gave myself a hard deadline. So many things I was looking forward to turned out bad.

        "74":"Here are my two cents about what doesn't do jack shit about depression. But first let me give you a story about what 'awakened' my demons. \n\nI've tried two types of therapy for my anxiety\/depression issues that were severely exacerbated by condition called CPPS (Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome) that I had to endure for 7 months. It started it 2020. Thankfully I am mostly over it.  This condition has no known cure cure, and you can only pray that it goes away on its own. Most ppl become suicidal due to this condition since it affects your life severely. Symptoms that it causes : urinary frequency (every 5mins you get the urge), inability to defecate (anal muscles are spasmed, pooping takes 1 hour and is incomplete,),urinary hesitancy, sexual dysfunction (blood cant flow into the penis due to spasm in pelvic floor), severe pain\/burning in urethra\/groin\/testicles. \n\nI've been to psychotherapy to sort of cope with this since it is recommended but also for the 'old demons' of regular depression - &gt; \"nothing provides joy\". \n\nSince most of you have the kind of depression that doesn't stem from CPPS but rather \"nothing provides joy\" kind I will touch on that. \n\nPsychotherapy is bullshit for that kind of depression. \nI've tried two types:REBT and Psychodynamic. \n\nPsychodynamic  : I had sessions 2\/3 times a week. It is quite expensive when you have that kind of frequency. The psychotherapist interprets what you say and 'guides you' to come up to your own conclusions. It is pure bullshit, because there is no 'guide' on how to overcome the issues, and at the end of the day the conclusion that you will inevitably come up with is that nothing provides joy which you've already known. \n\nREBT: this type of therapy is supposed to help you by identifying distorted thoughts and correcting them. This has some merit for ppl who have mild anxiety\/depression since mildly depressed ppl have it probably due to distorted thoughts e. g. I am fat and I will forever be ugly and nobody will love me. \nHowever there are no distorted thoughts in severe depression. You literally just have nothing that provides joy. You could argue that it is logical error since you haven't tried everything. However if you tried a bunch of stuff and nothing gives you joy then a clear pattern is formed that indicates that it is very unlikely that 'next new thing' will be any different. Also you could argue that severely depressed person doesn't have the motivation to even try anything so that argument puts the nail on the coffin. \n\nI've also tried SSRIs. They are bullshit, they didn't help one tiny bit. They caused a bunch of side effects and one possibly permanent side effect. They caused: weight gain and loss of libido. \n\nLoss of libido is still present even though I reduced my dose to minimal. I have zero libido\nIt is likely that I developed PSSD (Post SSRI sexual dysfunction) - dysfunction that doesn't go away even tho you quit antidepressant and can last indefinitely. \n\nMy advice to people who have severe depression is to ask psychiatrist about antidepressants that don't cause loss of libido (Wellbutrin), or about MAOI these can cause it but it is much more rare (as far as I know) and are much better when it comes to severe depression.Do your own research about MAOI since I can't vouch about it not causing sexual dysfunction but I think I'm right. \nAlso Ketamine\/Spravato is recommended for treatment resistant depression, and I think it doesn't cause sexual dysfunction. \nMagic shrooms\/Psylocibin is new treatment that seems promising for severe depression. \n\nPsychotherapy will just be a waste of time and money in my opinion if you suffer from severe depression. I am fucking angry that I even wasted my fucking money on it. Especially the psychodynamic one that doesn't even have any scientific data showing it is effective. It is not even in the domain of science since it isn't falsifiable. I should've done my fucking homework. \n\nHope this helps you and saves you some money.",

        "77":"  \n\nThis is probably the first time ever that I opened up my depression to someone else. It\u2019s probably gonna be really long, so someone might not finish this. And English is not my first language you see, so there would be a lot of mistake and my choice of words and sentences might be not really good.\n\nI just feel so tired right now. So I\u2019m from South-East Asia and in here, parents\u2019 words are very important and it is just the tradition here. It is almost impossible to change now for me. So during Covid-19 I come home to live with my parents because I\u2019m 22, don\u2019t have a job, still in college with not very good grade. I keep trying u know help around the house, housework. But for all things you do, they will all down fall to just one mistake. Then here come \u201cThese day, you are doing nothing. All you is eat. Not helping around\u2026\u201d much more. I did tried talk back a few things only to worsen the mood. I just don\u2019t what to do to please them.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, my parents have to become worker in South-Korea to make money to support family. During that time, kids grow very slowly. I didn\u2019t feel much at first. Without knowing, I start to feel distant from everyone. I start to be by myself more and more. I can\u2019t focus on my study. And when I fail one test with was quite important but won\u2019t affect my final grade, it was a hard fall. I just can\u2019t get up. \n\nIn college, it just got worsen. My memory start failing my choice of subject is completely off. Interior design for one year was a no because it is expensive and not my type of thing to do. IT third now, my mind is now just tired. I can\u2019t focus. I should have choose Foreign Language. But now I\u2019m scared cause I\u2019m using my parents\u2019 money for college payment. And it is third year now. I feel like a complete failure and really afraid to talk to my parents about it.  What to do?\n\nIdk why but I\u2019m really scared of getting a job even a part time. I can hardly breathe when thinking about moving forward to try new things. And I\u2019m not close to my friend as before as I start to get depression.\n\nI\u2019m gay but I never open up about it. No one know I am one except for one of my friend but he was really rich and hanging out with him just feel so awkward. I only had one crush in high school which I confessed him when I\u2019m in college which was failure. And I haven\u2019t speak to him since. So I never really been in relationship. Maybe I can find one?? Nahhh I\u2019m not a good looking guy, too tall to be a bottom, too skiny ( I have been in the same 48 kg for 5 years now never gain any weight). Gym? I just don\u2019t have time and feel really embarrassed about going. I am too afraid to be in a real relationship.\n\nI\u2019m a very boring person. I\u2019m bored of things really fast even game. I can\u2019t chat for long. I start feel bored and run out of topic to talk about really fast which make me afraid of chatting with someone else cause I\u2019m afraid I might upset them.\n\nSo this is it. Thank you guys for reading this. There are a lot more but these are things that are mainly really not in good way right now. Also I\u2019m feel much better while writing this which make me really sleepy. I did think of suicide a couple time but never get to do it. Thank guys!!",

She won't even talk to me unless I have some sort of missing assignment in class that I'm already stressing about, and she makes it worse by constantly yelling at me about it. I've been getting bullied a lot on social media and at school. A lot of people told me to just end it and I'll admit I have had thoughts about it, but then I think of some of the people that really care about me and how it could gravely impact their life, so I just get really upset knowing I could ruin someone else's life. I've been getting less and less sleep everyday to the point where I don't sleep at all. Sometimes I won't even eat because I'm not in the mood for it.

        "106":"Let me just say my relationship with my father went downhill when I was about 8.  He was having problems with his own parents and that created problems within our relationship.  I was a daddy's girl before then.\n\nThe actual 'verbal abuse' started in the beginning of the 7th grade.  I'd turned 13 and started wearing black band tees and chopped my hair at about shoulder length (parents thought it was too short but were ok with it for the time being) anyways, the first 2 months of school that year became a total nightmare.  My dad started suddenly telling me that I looked like a weirdo and that kids at school probably saw me that way to.  He'd give long lectures about my style and how no ones gonna wanna marry a girl who dresses the way I do, but the way he spoke to me always felt like the way a father would speak to his rebelious son.  Just his tone and constant swearing.  Idk.  Btw my sister was the one who got me into that emo style\/culture and actually sported a haircut similar to mine, but much longer, so she didn't get much of the same treatment. \n\nAnd I mean, I get it.  Even I still cringe at the style I had back then, but looking back, I don't think the way he spoke to me was the way a father should ever speak to his own daughter.  I wonder if he acts that way towards me because maybe he wishes he had a son, but instead ended up with me?  Everyone did assume I'd be a boy before my mom had me.  I am also certainly the tomboy of the sisters. Maybe that says something?  Either way, I hate the way he speaks to me.  He has often told me I should be more feminine and whatnot.  Not in a creepy way but in more of a \"why can't you just be a normal daughter\" type of way.  How can I feel feminine when you make fun of my style, call me a \"fucking weirdo\", constantly tell me to \"be normal\" and ask me if theres something wrong with me mentally?  A lot of kids go through stupid phases, but both my parents, mainly dad, made me feel as though it was much deeper than that.  I remember them telling me \"you'll never be successful if you continue dressing that way\".  They were truly disappointed in me.  A 13 year old girl, still going through puberty, starting to compare herself to other girls, starting to have her own insecurities, and on top of that... having her own father insult her looks and speak to her as though he's speaking with a grown man, thinking that maybe it'll get her to stop dressing that way and finally be normal.  Let's just say it made me look and feel even less feminine. \n\nI ended up cutting my hair into a pixie (kept the bangs long due to insecurities) and my parents went completely bonkers.  Yes it was kinda bonkers and I was just a stupid kid, but their insults after that just made me feel even worse.  They started telling me I looked like a boy.  \"Why are you trying to look like a boy?\"  \"If you think you're ugly, why make yourself look worse?\"  \"Are you mentally ill?  Is that why you dress that way\"  \"Do you know what a dyke is?  Well you look like one.\", most of the insults coming from my dad.  He then one day asked me in front of everyone if I was a lesbian.  I said no and he accused me of lying.  I ran to my room crying, only to have mom come in and ask me the same question once more, but in a calmer tone. No, I'm not a lesbian! Stop asking! \n\nThe tip on the icing was when I was sitting on the couch watching tv, my dad came and sat on the other sofa, mom was in living room to btw.  Few seconds later he tells me, \"Do you know the short hair makes you look fat?\"  My mom defended me and told him to stop and that he shouldn't say that.  It's funny cuz I had kinda thought I was chubby, as most young girls do, but he pretty much confirmed it for me in my mind.  I ditched the t shirts and wore only sweaters after that to cover myself. He then starts calling me \"sweater girl\". Kinda funny...until he went out of his way to actually BURN one of my sweaters. And everyone laughed. What's also funny is that I'd seen pictures of me at that age and I was thin, never fat. Guess that was just his way of trying to yet again convince me to \"be normal\".\n\nThe thing is, I know he loves me very much. But he has issues controlling his anger and has his own insecurities, as well as problems with his own parents, specifically his mother. It makes him say the stupidest things. I just wish he was strong enough to have not had it affect our relationship. Because it's truly what's caused so much pain in my own life that wouldn't be there otherwise, like my social anxiety, my depression, the fact that I've been homeschooled for 4 years since I was 14,  all because I couldn't stand being around people anymore.  Everyday is the same day for me.  Every week is the same for me.  I don't go out.  I have no friends.  I'm am alone.\n\nI know this is long. I just really needed to vent this out somewhere.

        "113":"Not sure if this belongs here or in a different sub or of it even belongs in a sub at all...if anyone has suggestions on where else to put this mess of a post let me know and I'll take it down.\n\nI recently went to the dentist after 3 years. I was never great at taking care of my teeth (mostly due to mental health reasons), and I avoided going to the dentist because of anxiety. Well, turns out I need a lot of dental work done. I have multiple cavities (more than 10), need two crowns, had a root canal and possibly might need another root canal for a different tooth. I decided to start all this work because I wanted to be more confident in my self and in my smile, but it's having the opposite effect.\n\nThree weeks ago I had fillings done on 3\/4ths of my mouth. Ever since then my bite has just been off. Everytime I close my mouth to chew something they feel like they knock into each other. I've gone to my dentist at least 4 times to get them adjusted but he never adjusts them right. I tell him while I'm in the chair that they are still off and he basically tells me to deal with it. Last week I went in everyday to get them adjusted and I'm still stuck with pain and the inability to chew or close my mouth.\n\nOne of my teeth had an infection for nine months. I was dealing with it, but needed a root canal. A few days ago my dentist thought that the pain I was having from the bad adjustments on the fillings was due to the pain of the infected tooth, so he scheduled me an emergency root canal. I'm now in pain from that, plus I'm still in pain from the badly adjusted fillings. \n\nI still need the two crowns (one being on the tooth with the root canal I just had done) and the last 1\/4th of my cavities done. I might also need another root canal for a different tooth.\n\nI haven't eaten solid food in 3 weeks. I've broken down in tears and had panic attacks every other, and sometimes every day, from the pain of my teeth and the frustration of not being able to eat real food. My boyfriend asks me if I want to get pizza or some other solid food and I have to say no even though I want that food so bad. I know the minute I start chewing and those fillings hit each other, I know I'll be in intense pain so therefore I can't eat solid food. I'm so sick of applesauce, yogurt, pudding, mashed potatoes and ice cream. It's been three weeks and I just want to eat some real food. I've lost 10 pounds because I'm not getting the proper nutrients for my body no matter how much food I eat. \n\nLet's add in the financial stress too. I'm 23 and on state insurance so basically nothing is covered and I'm paying for this out of pocket. My parents refuse to help and I just graduated college last year. With COVID, I'm unable to get a job in my field so I'm stuck working a minimum wage job that I don't even want to go to anymore because I'm so depressed and in pain from my teeth.\n\nI also work night shift and my dentist is only open 9-5, which is when I sleep. So, I've been getting very little sleep in an attempt to try and make my teeth better and to not be in pain. The fact that I have to keep going to the dentist daily is making me lose sleep and lose my mind.\n\nI'm also ruining my relationship with my boyfriend because all I do is complain to him about my teeth or that my teeth hurt. Even when I don't mean to. He knows something is wrong and everytime intell him it's my teeth he does a big sigh and I can tell he's sick of me telling him. When I have mental breakdowns because of it, I know he is just comforting me because he has no other choice. I feel so bad because I'm being a horrible girlfriend who just wants to cry and complain about my teeth. I haven't been intimate or spent any time with him because of the mental state I'm in and because of the pain I'm in. It's only a matter of time before he breaks up with me over this.\n\nI'm so sick of my teeth, I honestly sometimes wish that they would just be knocked out of my face so I didn't have to deal with them and the stress they are causing me. They have caused me more harm than good. They hurt, they're causing me not to be able to eat properly, they're ruining my sleep schedule, they're ruining my finances, they're ruining my relationship with my boyfriend and they're ruining my mental health. I'm mentally drained and I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up crying because of all the harm they've done to my life in the past few months. Like during my breakdowns I have suicidal thoughts over this stress of my teeth. (Want to disclose that I'm not feeling suicidal right now, but in the past have been suicidal over my teeth and got help for it). I wish I never would have gone to the dentist to find out what work I needed done. All it did was put me in a worse place.",

        "119":"I've been seeing my therapist monthly for several years. My husband and I also see an LMFT bi-weekly and have been for the past year-ish. Our LMFT suggested I ask for more frequent appointments with my therapist, which I agreed to do. Unfortunately, at my last appointment with my therapist (29 April), right as I was about to ask, he apologized saying he did not have even a half hour open in May, so offered 8 June. I agreed to that because he mentioned scheduling \"...for my more needy patients,\" implying I'm not one of those. I still felt discouraged, sad, and cried after that appointment because one of the last things he told me was \"you miss your partner,\" and it hit hard how much I miss my husband. (see note at bottom)\n\nNow earlier in April, my therapist offered me a 30 minute call out of the blue saying \"I know you don't have any support so here I am,\" which moved me almost to tears because I know he has a lot of patients. I work for the same organization just in a different department, and have my own patients to keep track of so I understand the stress it can cause. Perhaps I am incorrect in assuming I would be seen more frequently if he thought I needed it. I know I need to communicate this, I'm just not sure how. I also feel fearful of becoming a needy patient.\n\nJust FYI, my husband is in military training and will be away for at least a year.

To the point that I\u2019m making lies about days I can\u2019t work to make it more believable. I sent my application for school way too late and haven\u2019t received a response back. in my parents eyes I wasted a year, because I didn\u2019t go to school right after. I\u2019m now scrambling to try to apply to the community college and get my shit together. And by scrambling i mean keeping it in the back of my mind until I eventually crash and burst out on the wrong person, or actually apply. I can\u2019t even lie to myself and say I\u2019m trying my best.\n\nI went out for ftour (breaking fast for Ramadan) at the restaurant I work at and when we were cleaning up and trying to take our food home I got called fat by my coworker Alex for taking food home. \n\u201cHe\u2019s already 300lb why would he want more!?\u201d\nEven though I laughed it off and my uncle wanted to yell at him I just cleared the situation so nobody had to feel bad.

I'm a 19 year old \\[male\\]  in first year of uni -(Maths&amp;Physics) and I've: played the piano since I was six, produce music (some of which is now on spotify) and i am a \"triathlete\" (train 12-15 hours\/week) ps. running is my entire life - though I'm not great at it yet.\n\nMy flatmate, Wendy, is one of my best friends. Over the pandemic we spent around 5 months living on our own (in the same bed since not in uni halls) and everything was great. I have never been in a relationship and I am not ready for one, I made that crystal clear to her before I even invited her to stay with me over the 5 months. We had somewhat a physical relationship, though we never had sex. She asked why and the main was because I didn't want to lead her on, I told her that and would regularly check if she was okay living with me despite not having an emotional relationship - I know that wouldn't work for some people and I really liked spending my time with her. Throughout this time I didn't see anybody from uni (I was home) though I kept in close contact with a girl called Lisa. I picked up a few running and cycling injuries and had to give up training for a few weeks and it fucking broke me (still recovering, but doing much better).\n\nRecently, Wendy told me she is in love with me. I friendzoned her and immediately stopped anything physical that we had ever done - I really want this friendship to work. But she is NOT okay. i have spent 3 nights over the past two weeks (where I go to sleep at 4am, waking up at 7am for training) with her as she's having a panic attack . I am trying everything I can. She is now back home since my mum (a qualified counsellor) conviced here that staying in uni is not a good idea - though Wendy wouldn't listen to me when I said it.\n\nOn top of this, my cycling injury is now back and I am picking up a bad shoulder from swimming and S&amp;C work. Music rooms aren't open and so I haven't practiced piano in a month (which is a big fucking deal). I can't run\/cycle\/swim how I would like to, I can't practice music and I have no motivation to produce. I hate my uni degree (it's really hard and i have no motivation) though I know when out of this rut I will begin to enjoy it again. And, worst of all, I can't stop thinking about Lisa. I thought I didn't want a relationship but she is fucking everything to me. What is Wendy gonna do when she knows how I feel about Lisa? I'm scared she's gonna do something severe. I don't know if I'm falling inlove with Lisa but all I know is that I would die for her.\n\nYou're probably wondering why I have titled this what I have, but I can do a lot of great things (cocky, I know) and yet I still look in the mirror and see a 'failure'. I just want to be satisfied with who I am but I have no love for myself. I have dealt with \"depression\" (not really, but feeling constantly down for months on end) and a developing ED which I have now overcome - I don't want it to come back.\n\nps.

I can't control my emotions, they take over.\n- My motivation\/perseverance is minimal to not there at all, I can hardly take care of myself (eat, drink, hygiene) so doing things I want or need to do are just out of the question.\n\nWhen I'm in this fase I'm out. I just can sleep, I walk because I need to and I'm happy my parents provide me with food.\n\n**Making my own stress thermometer**\n\nI made a chart where I put the 4 measures next to each other and made 4 rows under it:\n\n- RED: burn out \ud83d\ude2b\n- ORANGE: stressed \ud83d\ude16\n- YELLOW: minor stressed \ud83d\ude1e\n- GREEN: peaceful \ud83d\ude0c\n\nIn every cell I put indicators. For example when I'm in yellow I can still watch a new movie, but not in orange, but usually not fully just about an hour. In orange I loose motivation.\n\nThis way I can track my daily stress level.\n\n**Origin of my stress**\n\nI know I have some beliefs and expectations that cause me to ignore my feelings of need for rest.\n\nIt feels like the emotions of the beliefs and expectations are prioritised higher then my feeling of tiredness. Actually my whole wellbeing is prioritised less then my beliefs and expectations.\n\n**How I plan to recover**\n\nI'm resting right now, I'm lucky I get the time from my job to be sick and get paid leave.\n\nDaily I rest, walk, attend to my plants, clean up my house, I try to do at least 2 or 3 small tasks which I know are good for my wellbeing even though it can be hard.\n\nI'm mindful, I meditate and I'm very aware of my emotions. When they pop up I try to understand what belief or expectation is behind the emotions. When they pop up when I need to make a difficult choice I choose rationally for my wellbeing. Rest, rest and more rest (physical, mental and emotional). Even though it takes a lot of courage to overcome the emotions I get not listening to my beliefs and expectations.\n\nI'm not helping anybody when I can't even do things for myself!\n\nAfter making a choices like this: I get proud of myself because I choose me \ud83e\udd73\n\n**Motivation and perseverance**\n\nI have noticed that my motivation and perseverance grows when I'm more rested again \ud83d\ude03 So, I started to do things that I love to do and give me satisfaction.",

All started when my taste and smell senses decreased a lot for a few weeks, took 3 covid tests and all negative. During the same time my right arm started to hurt, then my right leg and some time later my whole right side of body went numb (not like paralized numb but skin feels numb and tight). I also have buzzing in my arm and leg and my fingers feel stiff (a few days ago my little toe in right leg went numb too - like really can\u2019t move it). And my jaw hurts a lot on the right side - that jaw thing has been going of for the last year, dentists say nothing is wrong. I noticed that I clenched my teeth sometimes so thought that maybe I am just so stressed and this is the outcome. But right now I don\u2019t clench my teeth but my jaw pain is still back (with all these new symptoms). Anyway I have been to my doctor and neurologist and right now I am waiting for MRIs (neuro wants to eliminate MS). When this all first started I didn\u2019t feel more stressed or anything but now of course I am stressed. I feel kinda fine some days and then the other days (like today) my arm and leg are in so much pain (I think nerve pain, my skin feels very sensitive and almost painful to touch too) and I just feel so weak and tired and only want to stay in bed and feel like I want to cry. \nSo I guess my question is that could all these symptoms be because of stress or anxiety? My neuro seems nice but all the other doctors seemed to think and said that \u201cmaybe you are just stressed\u201d. Of course I don\u2019t want to get diagnose like MS from my neuro but at the same time I really would not want to believe that just stress could cause these kind of symptoms.

The symptoms I have are 24\/7 and started in October of 2020 after I got my top wisdom teeth removed. I was not sedated or put to sleep as they were not impacted. This was also a very very stressful time due to covid, losing my job, being on awful unemployment etc. \n\nSince this time I have had 24\/7 head pressure felt mainly in the top back of my head. If I wiggle\/lift my ears or raise my eyebrows I feel the pressure originating from this top back crown area but my whole head feels heavy all the time. Nothing makes it worse\/better. Along with this comes horrible brain fog and lightheadedness. I constantly feel spacey\/woozy kind of like I'm outside my body or off in gravity. I have recently noticed that the more active I try to be (When I try to workout) the more spacier and off I feel. It's not that I'm going to fall but moreso my space in gravity is just off. My vision is also blurry when looking at a computer screen or tv or just in general, like if I have to fill out papers my vision is blurry and off. My vision feels like it's constantly spazzing, like nothing is sharp. I am unable to drive especially when there are many lanes as I feel in a fog and can't accurately pick up a lot of scenery. I also cannot go into stores because the scenery makes me lightheaded when theirs a lot going on. I also feel pressure behind my eyes which makes my eyes tired. \n\nMy anxiety has been very high from these symptoms and if I start to panic everything gets worse. I have been having weird anxiety riddled dreams as well as these symptoms have been here 24\/7 for nearly 7 months and no doctor has a clue.  I have gotten MRI, MRA, MRV, CT Scan. I have been to 3 neurologists, 2 ENT, emergency room twice etc and nobody has any information on what this is or how to help.

On top of the personal stress of breaking up and moving during covid, my performance at work has been poor.  Despite repeated attempts to correct bad behaviors with the support of my company and manager, My performance has not improved and I am experiencing nearly daily mental breakdowns and anxiety\/panic attacks.  I am also not able to sleep for more than 3-4 fitful hours a night.  At this stage I strongly believe quitting will be to the benefit of everyone.

        "196":"Hello everyone, I've been having anxiety attacks for a year and a month and most of the attacks were happened in last 3 months. With covid pandemic, we couldn't go outside and a result of this was vitamin D3 deficiency for me. I am 16 years old, male and I'm aware of what my age brings upon me. I fought against myself for almost a year, got the blood results and sat very disappointed. I knew myself very well and I'm not a person who gets affected by emotions so easily. And I didn't have anything can hit me to ground. Just nothing. I knew it was a biological thing but with these circumstances I couldn't get any help. I want to describe myself,my problems and the help I want to have from you.\n\nI'm a very thinking person, have so much opinions, knowledge on many things. I love philosophy and music. These two things are my favourite in my life.  Sadly, I can't even remember myself, thoughts, artists i love, songs i live with, past I had lived and so on. I've been having these compliments since February 2020; can't remember things, can't think about anything, can't concentrate, always feeling tired and the list goes on. Long story short, I kinda have a fog on my brain (I thought about this when i was new to these). I always found a solution for my problems and never disappointed myself but I can't get out of this anymore. I fought back with this 6 times maybe and I don't have any morale to stand up for one more time. I can't express myself anymore; my school, relationships, inner peace is getting effected heavily everyday. I'm losing my abilities, my skills are diminishing, my creativity is fading away. I can't listen to music anymore, can't find a purpose, can't use my time efficiently anymore.\n\nMy Vitamin D3 results are on the floor. The low vitamin limit is 20 mg\/L and mine is 5.4 mg\/L. I started taking 3.000 iu daily supplement for almost 2 months and I am a lot better than before but the psychological consequences are still upon me. I talked with a friend of mine and they said you may have anxiety. I agree with this, my last few months corrupted by it and depression. I am not a depression person and know how to fight against but heavy stress from my school is blocking my way out and I feel hopeless. I'm afraid of losing my thoughts, my mind, my personality, everything I love and care, interest in my hobies. I read that vitamin d is the background of these diseases. Also I'm having sleep problems for months, this is a factor too. Please enlighten me if you know about this and had experiences. Thanks.\n\nI'm sorry if I used english bad, complicated. I'm in a very tough situation while writing this, please understand me, I can't even write things in my mind I'm so sorry about this.",

Their lack of empathy is our there, where our people (not the the poorest ones but especially them) are dying without oxygen. Our government did not plan in one whole year, and now we have no vacant hospital beds, no ICU beds, no ventilators in the national capital and other states.

It's finals week and anxiety\/stress is at an all time consistent high. On top of that, our family puppy has been great but I think my school anxiety has trickled in to me worrying over him more than I should, and I constantly get overwhelmed with all the things I have to get done. I can't even enjoy food because I am always thinking too much and get caught up in the stress of school. I literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping, and I immediately said \"wow he's depressed isn't he\" when he's just SLEEPING. I went out to get food, totally fine, no problem. As soon as I got home it hit me again with all the stuff I have to do. The pandemic has 1000% affected my mental health especially recently, where I don't get any enjoyment of stuff at home because I am always in front of a damn computer screen. I used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school, and now I see home as the place where I do everything and there's no distinction between relaxing and school. But - the one thing I can hold onto is that it is going to PASS. All of this is going to pass at some point, the brain is just rewiring itself because of the situation happening globally. It's going to be okay, the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. If this spoke to anyone out there, feel free to let me know how you're feeling. How are you coping? \\*\\*And if there's any puppy pros in the crowd, please let me know what you did to help release some of that feeling of wanting constantly to helicopter over them during times of stress. When I feel relieved, I don't feel any need to check on him constantly or obsess over little things around the house, just when I am overwhelmed; and then, I don't get anything productive done anyways. I always remind myself I am not alone - and neither are you. Even talking to strangers about it can be soothing in a way, just a little reminder that there's someone else out there in your boat during such a difficult time. My counselor said to normalize what is normal during an abnormal time period. And also, don't forget to tell your pets you love them.",
        "202":"Hey guys, I've started stuttering basically out of the blue a year ago at 22 years of age... I don't really know the cause of it, It could be drugs, medications I take (Valium and Sulpiride), could also be major traumatic events I've experienced throughout my life..\n\nBasically it started as I know one day when I was out with my mom and my sister. That day I've experienced severe depersonalization and remember when we were talking about something, It was my turn to talk but at the first word of the sentence I startet to repeat the first letter over and over again and just stopped talking.. We were just sitting there silently embarrassed about what had just happened lol..\n\nI do remember a month ago before this event when I was taking speed (amphetamine) I just had a mild stutter at a sentence once a week and didn't think anything of it.. Anyways, from that event with my mom and sister I kind of developed a fear of stuttering and started to research stuttering and it just became worse...It kind of became a habit to stutter as always before speaking to anyone I would think of how not to stutter and of course it worked the opposite as you all know..Most people don't even know I stutter because I hide it pretty well, I would stop before a stutter and kinda pretend I'm thinking or jus say \"umm\" and try to find the right word I would not stutter on.. I've also asked my mom if I've ever stuttered as a child, she said that I didn't.. So I think that developemental stuttering is out of the picture.. and also no one in my family had any kind of speech disorder..\n\nI really don't know what to do with this, I'm constantly stressing myself out.. I've said to myself that I would never go to a speech specialist because I would think about my stutter even more, I just try to forget about it.. and it sometimes works when I'm happy or preoccupied with something that I don't have time to think about my speech.. I'm also scared shittless of going to a neurologist because I'm a bit of a hypochondriac lol.. and the fact that I've started to forget things, words, sometimes I can't understand a sentence and have to read it 10 times to even try to understand it, but it happens very rarely.. All of rhis could be because of the medication or sever stress.. I really don't know.. So basically I'm asking you guys if you ever had a similar experience, or if you know anyone who experienced something like this.. It could also be that I'm so fucked up mentally that I've just imagined my stutter and the fear of it keeps it alive lol",

With this back and forth of restrictions and uncertainties, many people seem to just be so sick of it and have started to ignore the restrictions and hanging out as normal. Working in healthcare, especially as a frontline worker, I have a hard time doing that. I certainly don't want to be the person to be a super spreader since I work at multiple sites.

Countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Mayans and the Aztecs, and the Australian Aborigines, to name just a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source of enlightenment, illumination, and wisdom. \n\nWhile the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on Earth because the Earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields.\n\nOn a grand scale, it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between the sun's energy, the Earth's energy, and the energy of all living species. On a micro level, all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit or vegetable to understand this interdependence. \n\nConsciously absorbing that energy to combine with your own Spiritual Energy has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more.\n\nYour spiritual energy goes under many different names like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pit\u012b, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.\n\nHere's a 3 minute [YouTube video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/uKdiTTbWbIA) expanding more on the benefits and how to, actually absorb the energy from the sun, through your own self-induced voluntary goosebumps from positive events\/thoughts\/memories\/feelings.",

I feel like everyone at my office hates me. They think i'm \"boring\". No. I'm just the only one in the office who doesn't have anyone friends, relationships, or fun outside of the office. I don't have a lot of fun and exciting experiences in life so I literally have nothing to talk about. I\"m judged negatively for this everyday. I beat me self up for this everyday. Its like i'm being jumped by a bunch of bullies and i'm the worst one. Support doesn't exist. I live with people I don't talk to at all. No love. I'm unattractive to everyone. I feel like people are just mannequins waiting to tell me that I need to do more or I haven't done enough....They want me to go out and experience things they don't want to be a part of. It's like if you don't want to be a part of my life then don't \"help\" me. You are a person too. I'm looking at you too. I'm trying to talk to you too. I'm trying to build a relationship with you too. Everyone acts like you. Everyone wants to \"help\" me like you. Everyone wants to push me away like you. None of you are different. That's why I don't talk. No one is different. No one wants to build anything with me. Everyone expects my life to already be built so I can entertain them from a distance. I want love. I want friends. I want a girlfriend. I want to have fun times with people who want to have fun times with me.\n\nLife's not worth living otherwise.",

        "247":"I have immersed myself into my career at the company I have been working with for 5 years this March. I am in my mid 20's and in a position that everyone said I couldn't do when I was promoted. The first 3 months were rough, but I learned from my mistakes and got comfortable and do my job well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first year and a half in management I was always stressed, but I was not as overwhelmed as I am now, and I seemed to enjoy myself outside of work more. I got to a point around the 2 year mark in management where I was super comfortable where I was and was working regular hours (45 hours a week or so). When Coronavirus hit, it was like our workflow increased, with less people to work, and more demand on us as managers.\n\nI went through one of the hardest summers working with minimal help, doing more projects then ever. Follow this by Hurricane Sally, worked 60+ hours for a few weeks, customers constantly not being understanding of the situation and only making me feel like I was failing them, to no fault of my own. \n\nThe next few months my workload seemed to grow exponentially, but I was unable to focus and keep up with where I know I need to be. I eventually go to the doctor and test for ADHD and get prescribed Adderall. ( I should add I was already taking Adderall at times for a month or two prior because I could not focus at work whatsoever). \n\nThe Adderall helped me more then I could've hoped, I was now as high functioning as I used to be and was knocking work out. It has leveled out some now and I feel normal on it now but still get positive results out of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am in the same boat as last spring, 40% of employees I need to keep up with workflow, certain material is hard to come by or non existent, constant weather issues, and customers just keep approving work. \n\nI am working almost always 7 days a week. I'm up by 445 and wont get home until 5 or 6 on average but I have a few days every week  I work till 7 or 8 to finish a job or get material. I now even spent my money to setup an office at home so I could work in my free time just to try and catch up. We are working skeleton crews, and seems there is no end in sight to the labor shortage. \n\nA lot of the responsibilities I feel so overwhelmed and stressed by are ones I have taken on myself, because no one else was. I have an ownership mentality and treat this business as it was my own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that's the work part of it....\n\nI had an almost 5 year relationship with the girl I was in love with, that ended in me heartbroken and afraid to trust any one. I kept to myself but talked to a few women here and there. I found one, that I had any real connection with, and that ended as a failed relationship. I fell more in love with this woman then I ever felt with my previous girlfriend, and was in a dark place when she left. Follow this by months of me feeling like I wasn't enough and no one I wanted, wanted me. \n\nI have a handful of good friends, and a couple that are one of a kind. But I always feel like I am bothering them, or just there to be there but I know this is me overthinking and all that. \n\nI also rented a house with my \"best friend\" that has turned into a nightmare. Can't say anything without him getting defensive, no help around the yard or house, constantly taking advantage of me being nice. He was also working with me and turned into a BUM and was missing work constantly and always so negative to be around. So add all that stress at work and come home to a house you hate the other person there and have to dread being home until he moves out. \n\nThe past two months have been the hardest I've ever dealt with mentally and physically. \n\nI'm working 10-12 hours a day and coming home and putting proposals or schedules together. I feel like I cant take a day off, much less a whole weekend. Its like we are batting against the odds and something goes wrong every week. But we are also doing great and revenue out the wazoo. All while working salary and not being compensated for the overtime. \n\nI FEEL LIKE IM ABOUT TO EXPLODE. \n\nEvery day I feel like I'm about to have a meltdown and crash mentally. My mental health seems to have  its days.

Everything on planet Earth emits a different frequency. A frequency is also called a vibration. It's also called Energy. It is quantifiable and it is measurable. Every atom emits a frequency. Your DNA at the lowest level emits a unique frequency.\n\nSo your brain is a receiver and a transmitter a frequency. That's the first concept and the second concept is the Law of attraction. Which says, whatever frequency you emit, That exact same frequency is drawn to you. There will be a magnetic pull.\n\nAnd this is a scriptural principle. For those of you who are Christians, Jewish, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists. All these books teach very similar Concepts. What you sow, also you reap. \n\nWhen you put out a frequency the Law of attraction says it must come back. Law of Attraction says by magnetic pull that has to bring that exact same frequency back. Which is based on whatever vibration you put out Whatever frequency that your brain, emotions, body and electromagnetic field puts out. It will attract and it will defy any physical law.\n\nSelf-induced goosebumps, from positive stimulis, allows you to take 100% control of your transmitter by vibrating different parts of your body, and is also able to, as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot) vibrate your whole physical body. \n\nWhen doing so, you consciously activate your physical and spiritual body to attract whatever intention, narrative, thought and emotions that are present when\nconsciously summoning your self-induced goosebumps.\n\nGoosebumps is just the physical reaction, but underneath it, theres a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as Energy.\n\nI've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pit\u012b, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more.\n\nIf you would like to know how to activate at will, fully control your Spiritual Chills and how its an important ingredient to the law of attraction, Here's a five minute video explaining just that.

        "273":"Work\u2019s a tough place to be mindful as it sometimes feels you\u2019re rushing from one thing to another. Sometimes that rushing can mean that we\u2019re either worrying about the future or regretting the past, picking over things that haven\u2019t gone as well as we hoped. How do we make work a happy place to be?\n\nAn obvious place to start is relationships and communication. When things are busy and we\u2019re feeling anxious, that's when our stress behaviours can surface. We\u2019re less aware of how other people are feeling and of the impact that we have on other people which can sometimes mean we that can say things we later regret. If we train ourselves to be aware when we\u2019re starting to get stressed out, we can breathe, notice the feeling and tend to our anxiety and anger with kindness. We can prioritise what we\u2019re doing - is everything that you\u2019re doing a must do? Can other people help us? The Plum Village app has a timer with a bell that chimes every so often so you can check in with your breath, your body, your thoughts and your feelings. Awareness is the cornerstone of tending to your stress with compassion.\n\nListening is also incredibly important and powerful in the workplace. We sometimes get caught up in the \u2018doing\u2019 completely and forget that building relationships is how big change happens. We\u2019re social animals and we have a bigger impact together, so to do this we need to build deep connections. When we listen to someone with our full awareness, without judging and without jumping to conclusions it\u2019s a genuine act of kindness, particularly if that person is having a difficult time. Deep listening is even more important when we disagree - understanding why someone feels the way they do isn\u2019t the same as agreeing with them and its critical to resolve conflict. Frequently when we feel stressed in work it\u2019s because we don\u2019t feel listened to so it\u2019s important to find people that you can express how you\u2019re feeling to. It\u2019s reasonable to expect your line manager to listen with understanding and respect - it\u2019s part of their role.\n\nAnother cause of stress at work is placing pressure on ourselves to get everything right first time and this obviously isn\u2019t realistic, especially if you\u2019re starting a new job. Failure is part of life and key to learning - when something doesn\u2019t go as well as we hoped, its not helpful to point fingers, especially at ourselves. The important thing is to learn, apply, grow and move on. I think as human beings for some reason we keep a book in our head of all the mistakes we ever made. If you\u2019ve learned from the mistake then it\u2019s time to let it go - if you feel your mind bringing out the book of doom and leafing through then rather than being swept away to regrets from the past you can smile to the book and let your mind put it back on the shelf.\n\nAnd finally what might be the most important, which is looking after each other. When we lift our head up from everyday tasks we can sometimes see that other people are suffering and it\u2019s important not to be a bystander. Checking in on people by asking if they\u2019re OK makes a huge difference - if you think that the wellbeing culture in your workplace isn\u2019t where it needs to be, just be aware that you have much more influence than you think. Just by asking the question of what we want our workplace to be can open a conversation that makes a huge difference to making work a happy, safe and fulfilling place - which is what it should be.\n\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/manifesto-for-a-kinder-workplace\/id1493806566?i=1000519594684)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https:\/\/www.google.com\/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/shaun-donaghy\/episodes\/Manifesto-for-a-kinder-workplace-e101nir)",

He's the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, a Nobel Prize winner, and a hugely sought-after speaker and statesman. Why is he so popular? Even after spending only a few minutes in his presence you can't help feeling happier.\n\nIf you ask him if he's happy, even though he's suffered the loss of his country, the Dalai Lama will give you an unconditional yes. What's more, he'll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that the very motion of our life is toward happiness. How to get there has always been the question. He's tried to answer it before, but he's never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand.\n\nThe Art of Happiness is the book that started the genre of happiness books, and it remains the cornerstone of the field of positive psychology.\n\nThrough conversations, stories, and meditations, the Dalai Lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement. Together with Dr. Howard Cutler, he explores many facets of everyday life, including relationships, loss, and the pursuit of wealth, to illustrate how to ride through life's obstacles on a deep and abiding source of inner peace. Based on 2,500 years of Buddhist meditations mixed with a healthy dose of common sense, The Art of Happiness is a book that crosses the boundaries of traditions to help readers with difficulties common to all human beings. After being in print for ten years, this book has touched countless lives and uplifted spirits around the world.",

        "283":"The four noble truths of the Buddha are simple to express: suffering is part of life, but happiness is possible and we make choices in every moment that lead us to happiness \/ suffering. The reason its revolutionary is that it paints a picture where our happiness isn\u2019t an external factor that's outside of our control, it\u2019s something that\u2019s within our reach with some practice, some patience and some persistence.\n\nWhich is not to say that you should beat yourself up for not being happy - its as important to practice non-judgement for yourself as for others, because every person you see if doing the best they can given their circumstances, including you.\n\nSo how do we train ourselves to be happy? The first step is to focus on the positive.  This might not be where our minds go automatically - humans have a natural negativity bias, a leftover from our our evolution where we\u2019re more focused on where there might be wolves than where there\u2019s flowers. This is completely understandable as it kept us alive for thousands of years but its something we need to be aware of when living our modern lives. Social media is very focused on the negative because that\u2019s what grabs our attention. Research shows that consuming any kind of media that is mostly negative affects our mental health. So we need to be careful what we consume.\n\nWe can also make a choice in every moment to focus on the good things we have and be grateful for them rather than seeing what we don\u2019t have or what\u2019s wrong. This takes time and patience as we might be very used to focusing on the negative. I live in Britain and we love to have a moan, especially about the weather but it\u2019s within our gift to appreciate the great things that are all around and regularly meditate on them or capture them in a gratitude journal. On the flip side can notice our judgmental thoughts arise, listen to them without getting involved or judging and watch them pass without acting on them. This is how we train ourselves to focus on the positive.\n\nThe second step is smiling to your difficulties. This sounds absolutely crazy - why would you want to smile when things are difficult? There's two reasons - the first is neurological. When you smile, even if you don\u2019;t feel like smiling, your brain releases chemicals which reduce stress and lift your mood - so its a very easy way to change how you\u2019re feeling. That's why we gently smile while we meditate.\n\nThe other way smiling helps is that it reduces the power those difficulties have over you in your mind. When we see anger, anxiety and sadness as our enemies that rob us of our peace then (naturally) we\u2019re afraid of them - we try and block out the thoughts and we run to consumption to help us out, which of course never works in the long term. When we smile to our difficulties, our difficult emotions and say, \u201cthere you are, my old friend\u201d, we accept what we\u2019re feeling without judgement, we reduce our suffering.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/training-yourself-to-be-happy\/id1493806566?i=1000518442780)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https:\/\/www.google.com\/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/shaun-donaghy\/episodes\/Training-yourself-to-be-happy-evial3)",

        "318":"As adult humans we\u2019re expected to have aims to achieve and a plan to get there - this is perfectly normal and there\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with planning for the future. But problems can arise when we get swept away by those plans and they result in us being stressed and unhappy in the present. This can happen for three reasons.\n\nThe first is expecting ourselves to be perfect. Many people, including me, have perfectionist traits, making us feel as if you need to achieve or maximise your potential. Perfectionism and that attachment to never failing can be very harmful to your wellbeing and self-worth - if you train your awareness with regular practice then you can notice that feeling arising, breathe, take a step back, look deeply into it and tend to your perfectionism with compassion and understanding.\n\nA second reason we get caught up in planning is that we attach our happiness to external factors like success, relationships and consumption. We make a decision that we\u2019ll be happy when we buy a house, get married, have kids, go on holiday, get a new job - you can think of a hundred things. We can\u2019t live happily in the future and human beings being what we are, when we get there and actually achieve the thing we\u2019ve been thinking about for so long, the joy tends to be fleeting and can\u2019t live up to how we\u2019ve built it up in our heads. Of course we can enjoy these things in the present but attaching our wellbeing to them in the future sets us up for suffering.\n\nThe final reason we overplan is we\u2019re are not noticing the joy and happiness in the world around us. It\u2019s a bit like watching a movie, knowing that the climax will be in the third act later on and not paying attention to the first hour and a half. That sounds silly, but we frequently get caught up in the future and ignore what\u2019s happening right now. Gratitude is a key practice in mindfulness and without training our awareness of the present moment we can miss the joy from the people in our life, the roof over your head, your pet dog, your lunch, the chair you\u2019re sitting on. \n\nIf you find that your plans for the future take you away from the present and you\u2019re always living in some other time and place, then consider letting go of the vision of the future that you\u2019ve painted for yourself and think about it more as a direction you\u2019re moving in rather than a destination. That direction should be helpful to your mental health, it should help to build your peace and happiness rather than being built on consumption, achievement or rushing around.\n\nPlease don\u2019t take any of this as a judgement! Like you I get caught up in plans for the future and rushing around, we all do. But sometimes we need to stop and taking a break from our striving so we can make aware, informed choices about whether our planning is really good for us or whether we need to breathe, relax and allow things to unfold in their own time.\n\n[Listen for more](link.chtbl.com\/8mIXYPFV)",

        "341":"**Non-judgment** - paying attention to your opinions as they arise. JKZ talks about how the human mind sorts things into boxes - good, bad, neutral. By taking a perspective of non-judgement and being aware we can take the most joy from the good things, accept the bad things (doing us less harm), and become more aware of the neutral things, realising how much they contribute to our lives. Of course judgmental thoughts still arise but we can simply observe them and let them pass without acting on them.\n\n\n**Patience** - letting things unfold in their own time. Meditation isn\u2019t difficult to learn but it does require patience and persistence. It takes some time to see the benefits of it, you need to stick with it. Doing it once a week is helpful but when you make time for a little bit of practice every day for six weeks the evidence shows its actually rewiring how your brain works, you\u2019re training yourself to be happy. Its also about being patience with ourselves, not setting expectations for achieving a standard in a specific time, and being patient with others who have lived their life through a set of circumstances we\u2019re not aware of. \n\n\n**Beginners mind** - seeing the world as if for the first time and seeing the infinite possibilities. Knowledge can limit our perception of what we don\u2019t know, part of becoming wise (rather than clever) is getting comfortable with what we don\u2019t know. When we accumulate a lot of knowledge and become jaded by experience we can lose touch with the joy in our lives.\n\n\n**Trust** - listening to our bodies and our senses. Trusting that if we let go of anxieties about the future and regrets from the past and live in the present that everything will be OK - because it really will. When we cultivate trust in ourselves through practice, when we build our calmness and peace and live in the present moment  we start to trust other people more because we\u2019re not jumping ahead to what they might do or questioning their motives - we\u2019re existing in the present taking their words and actions at face value. Really listening to other people with an open mind is when we make strong human connections. \n\n\n**Non-striving** - we\u2019re always trying to get somewhere, always running toward a destination. But an important aspect of mindfulness is realising that you have arrived in the here and now. We can\u2019t live happily in the future; if everything we\u2019re doing is to achieve, we sacrifice our wellbeing in the present. We tell ourselves we\u2019ll be happy when we get promoted, we get married, we have kids, when we retire. This is the only time we can be happy - mindfulness is called the art of stopping, sometimes we have to ease off with the future plans and enjoy where we are and who we\u2019re with.\n\n\n**Acceptance** - accepting that things are the way they are. Which is not to say you don\u2019t do anything about it, the idea is that you are aware in the present moment, you see things as they are and you can decide what it is you want to do. There\u2019s a myth that mindfulness somehow makes you OK with injustice and suffering - the opposite is true! When we accept the world in front of us, accept people, accept yourself, you can act out of emotional intelligence and compassion rather than anger or fear. \n\n\n**Letting go** - by identifying the attachments we have we can trace the roots of our anger, our fear, our sadness and understand why we react the way we do in certain circumstances. Once we apply our awareness to our attachments we can start to understand ourselves, we can start to feel compassion for ourselves, then we can start to let go of our suffering.\n\n\n[Listen for more](https:\/\/link.chtbl.com\/tDsqppjK)",

Taking a step back when needed, instead of rushing in. Rushing in when we feel like we need to.**\n\nLife changes &amp; when it does, that is the Universe showing us that we are ready for that change, the sole thing **we have to do, is embrace it.

Fred and Florence had been high school sweethearts lo these many years ago in the small town of Wandsworth, Canada. After high school, Fred left for a job in Toronto. When he came back a year later, Florence no longer lived in Wandsworth and Fred couldn\u2019t find her. Each of them went on to have good marriages with others. Yet after Florence\u2019s husband passed away and she discovered Fred\u2019s wife passed away, Florence found a way to connect with Fred, mainly to reassure him that things would get better over time. Well, one phone call turned into hours of phone calls, into finally meeting up together, and within 3 days (wait for it) \u2013 getting married! Such is the power of love.",

Expressing more gratitude certainly helped.   \n\n\nThen this lead to actually tracking my **Top 3 moments of the day** and writing them down in the notes app on my phone.   \n\n\nFinally, I was listening to the Tim Ferriss Show's interview of Jim Collins. And turns out that **Jim has the perfect method for tracking happiness**. He gives each day a score and tracks that score over time. His scale is as follows.   \n\n\n* 2 is a great day\n* 1 is a good day\n* 0 is a so-so day\n* \\-1 is a bad day\n* \\-2 is a really bad day\n\nAfter using this system for the past few years, I can say that it works. **It helps me to better gage my happiness levels**, and focus on doing the things that make ME the happiest in my daily life. Is every day great? No. But I am starting to **improve my days simply by giving each day a score**.   \n\n\nMy full and expanded article on \"How to track your happiness\"  is here: [https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/enjoying-life\/how-to-track-your-happiness\/170](https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/enjoying-life\/how-to-track-your-happiness\/170)  \n\n\nIf you are interested in tracking your happiness, please check out this post, which explains how the tracker works and has a link to download: \n\n[https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/resources\/happiness-tracker-spreadsheet\/502](https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/resources\/happiness-tracker-spreadsheet\/502)\n\n***Happy Happiness tracking everyone!***",

        "371":"Have you had an anxious over-reaction when something goes wrong -  you might think that if a relationship ends you\u2019ll never find someone else, if you fail an exam you can never have a successful career. You\u2019re imagining all the terrible things that are going to happen, it feels like the world is ending and the house of cards is falling apart. \n\nSo what\u2019s happening in our heads? The first thing that\u2019s going awry is that we\u2019re living in the hereafter. As humans we can\u2019t live with happiness and calmness in the future - we can only live a joyful life in the present. When we notice our minds are moving into the future we can stop, we can breath and we can focus on something in the present - maybe our breath, our surroundings or an activity.\n\nAs well as living in the future, we\u2019re predicting the worst possible outcomes - out of all the things that could possibly happen, our minds naturally go to the catastrophe. That's not something to worry about in itself - everyone has catastrophic thoughts and it kept us alive when human beings had to contend with predators and danger. \n\nYou probably don\u2019t see a lot of wolves and tigers so we can give ourselves permission to take a step back and think it through. When catastrophic thinking arises we need to be aware enough to notice the thought and ask ourselves whether it\u2019s really true or realistic. If it isn\u2019t we can allow the thought to pass out of awareness, without being swept away and without any harm or damage to us.\n\nA third driver of catastrophic thinking is the belief that you can\u2019t cope with whatever outcome you\u2019re afraid of, that you\u2019ll somehow fall apart. Monsters live in the dark, so shine the light of awareness on it - you\u2019ve coped with difficult experiences in the past and you have a much greater reserve of strength and resilience than you\u2019re aware of.\n\nEveryone experiences catastrophic thoughts, its natural and part of who we are - but our reaction to them decides whether they cause us suffering or they pass without harming us. Life is full of challenges as well as good and bad days; just because one day is bad does not mean all days will be bad. \n\nOne final thing to bear in mind is that is that we catastrophize more when we\u2019re anxious and our mental health is poor, so get a regular wellbeing routine in place with a little meditation and awareness every day.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/catastrophizing-how-to-stop-worrying-pt2\/id1493806566?i=1000513762561)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https:\/\/www.google.com\/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/shaun-donaghy\/episodes\/Catastrophizing---how-to-stop-worrying-pt2-et2qr5)",

It comes from going deep inside. \n\nIts interesting to me how we as humans know that its the best for us to follow and focus on how we feel inside but we still try to push them away. I remember growing up and feeling feels about what now is my identity at the surface and thinking **\"oh, I will grow out of it\",** I look back and laugh with joy how naive I was. \n\nWhen things are meant for us, when theres changes that need to be made with ourself, with our path, which is ultimately all for our path, we can continue to battle by self induced numbing, to think they will go away, or things will change, but we are just digging a deeper hole, but sometimes its needed for a given amount of time. \n\n**Its about realizing how we work as the individual, not what someone is telling us on the internet, lol not even me.
