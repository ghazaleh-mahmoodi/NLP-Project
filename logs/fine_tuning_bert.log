INFO:root:input text => I feel like my depression took my entire teen years from me. I spent all my free time in high school crying and self harming at home while everyone else had friends and hobbies and went to parties.
INFO:root:predicted lable for input text => depression
INFO:root:input text => Hello people of reddit, I'm in a dilemma. I feel like I need to reinvent myself. I'm very happy with my gf (not a problem), my family is ok, sometimes we have problems but you got to deal with it sometimes. 
INFO:root:predicted lable for input text => depression
INFO:root:input text => I have some of those friends but some of them take life a joke and it gets annoying.

I feel like I need to improve my current situation. I want a more mature friend group, I want to move out of my parents house but I work in a minimum wage job. I'm in major which I feel is bs unless I go to law school (political science, I chose it because I'm terrible at math and I love the political realm). a part of me wants to open up a small business but I don't know where to start. I'm stuck in a rut, I was very consistent with working out but for the past months I messed up my wrist, had my wisdom teeth pulled out, and got sick so it hasn't exactly been the best situation lol.

in conclusion, I'm a 19 yr old man trying figure out my place in this world. I want to open a small business to support me and my future family needs. I'm practical so I don't care about "luxury" everyone breaks their backs for(I try to practice minimalism) . I want to feel healthy and I want to have a group of friends that are mature and don't fuck around too much and actually respect me for trying to improve ( they roast me for trying to stay completely sober and trying to sleep earlier etc.) . I want to move due to the fact that sometimes I feel like I'm not home due to all arguing I have to go through. I want challenge, I want to be independent.
INFO:root:predicted lable for input text => depression
INFO:root:input text =>  I didnt even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn't control. Now I am 21 and just graduated college and Iam lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I’m just so broken right now. Can anyone relate to this crippling regret of missing out on what were supposed to be the best years of your life?
