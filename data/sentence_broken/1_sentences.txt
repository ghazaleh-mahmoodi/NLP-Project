your ideas of happiness can also be a reason for your bad habits / addictions.
maybe your ideas of happiness are the reason why you are not happy.
because when you have an idea of happiness you will only feel happy when the idea becomes reality.
without an idea of happiness you can see happiness in everything.
so if you have a lot of ideas of happiness i would also recommend to write down all these ideas on a piece of paper.
now you have written down everything, let everything go.
i would recommend meditation as a tool to let things go.

struggling to find real happiness and a deeper meaning in life.
i have a pretty good life, fiancé, decent paid job, good working hours, keep myself in shape, i have some pretty active hobbies and a close family.
all the kind of the things someone in a good position has.
yet non of this brings actual happiness or any feelings of content.
now i don’t want to sound like i lack perspective or that i’m ungrateful, because i do acknowledge being in a privileged position compared to others.
i feel the more i dig into this subject the worse it gets for me.
and the better i do in life get promoted in work, make more money, etc doing positive things that typically bring someone happiness does nothing for me deep down.
i feel like there’s an answer or deeper meaning to what’s going on in my life.
does anybody have any insight or advice/similar experiences?

i dont have a lot going for me right now.
im unemployed and i've just been bummed out about it.
i stay at home a lot because of it and i've been feeling lonely too, but everytime i get on social media i just feel that connection to society that i really need at this moment.
and i know it may sound stupid but im just glad for all the strangers out there commenting on tiktok and sharing their lives on instagram.
even if i dont know them, they feel like friends because we're viewing the same things online.
am i making any sense?
what's the most admirable trait in a person in your opinion.
fearlessness would probably be at the top of my list
work’s a tough place to be mindful as it sometimes feels you’re rushing from one thing to another.
sometimes that rushing can mean that we’re either worrying about the future or regretting the past, picking over things that haven’t gone as well as we hoped.
how do we make work a happy place to be?
an obvious place to start is relationships and communication.
when things are busy and we’re feeling anxious, that's when our stress behaviours can surface.
we’re less aware of how other people are feeling and of the impact that we have on other people which can sometimes mean we that can say things we later regret.
if we train ourselves to be aware when we’re starting to get stressed out, we can breathe, notice the feeling and tend to our anxiety and anger with kindness.
we can prioritise what we’re doing - is everything that you’re doing a must do?
can other people help us?
the plum village app has a timer with a bell that chimes every so often so you can check in with your breath, your body, your thoughts and your feelings.
awareness is the cornerstone of tending to your stress with compassion.
listening is also incredibly important and powerful in the workplace.
we sometimes get caught up in the ‘doing’ completely and forget that building relationships is how big change happens.
we’re social animals and we have a bigger impact together, so to do this we need to build deep connections.
when we listen to someone with our full awareness, without judging and without jumping to conclusions it’s a genuine act of kindness, particularly if that person is having a difficult time.
deep listening is even more important when we disagree - understanding why someone feels the way they do isn’t the same as agreeing with them and its critical to resolve conflict.
frequently when we feel stressed in work it’s because we don’t feel listened to so it’s important to find people that you can express how you’re feeling to.
it’s reasonable to expect your line manager to listen with understanding and respect - it’s part of their role.
another cause of stress at work is placing pressure on ourselves to get everything right first time and this obviously isn’t realistic, especially if you’re starting a new job.
failure is part of life and key to learning - when something doesn’t go as well as we hoped, its not helpful to point fingers, especially at ourselves.
the important thing is to learn, apply, grow and move on.
i think as human beings for some reason we keep a book in our head of all the mistakes we ever made.
if you’ve learned from the mistake then it’s time to let it go - if you feel your mind bringing out the book of doom and leafing through then rather than being swept away to regrets from the past you can smile to the book and let your mind put it back on the shelf.
and finally what might be the most important, which is looking after each other.
when we lift our head up from everyday tasks we can sometimes see that other people are suffering and it’s important not to be a bystander.
checking in on people by asking if they’re ok makes a huge difference - if you think that the wellbeing culture in your workplace isn’t where it needs to be, just be aware that you have much more influence than you think.
just by asking the question of what we want our workplace to be can open a conversation that makes a huge difference to making work a happy, safe and fulfilling place - which is what it should be.

we rush through life.
we always have this pressure, to do better, to be stronger, to work harder, but we forget to give time and space for ourselves.

go through this link: 
nearly every time you see him, he's laughing, or at least smiling.
and he makes everyone else around him feel like smiling.
he's the dalai lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of tibet, a nobel prize winner, and a hugely sought-after speaker and statesman.
why is he so popular?
even after spending only a few minutes in his presence you can't help feeling happier.
if you ask him if he's happy, even though he's suffered the loss of his country, the dalai lama will give you an unconditional yes.
what's more, he'll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that the very motion of our life is toward happiness.
how to get there has always been the question.
he's tried to answer it before, but he's never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand.
the art of happiness is the book that started the genre of happiness books, and it remains the cornerstone of the field of positive psychology.
through conversations, stories, and meditations, the dalai lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement.
together with dr.
howard cutler, he explores many facets of everyday life, including relationships, loss, and the pursuit of wealth, to illustrate how to ride through life's obstacles on a deep and abiding source of inner peace.
based on 2,500 years of buddhist meditations mixed with a healthy dose of common sense, the art of happiness is a book that crosses the boundaries of traditions to help readers with difficulties common to all human beings.
after being in print for ten years, this book has touched countless lives and uplifted spirits around the world.
the life we want to live, comes from intention but more importantly faith.
faith that whatever we are focusing on, that what we are putting our everything into it, will happen with time.
do your best, express.
isn't that why we really started creating?
isn't that why we decided to focus on our passions and what is from our heart?
its interesting to me when true intentions are shown, **set your intentions before you cross through, they will be shown.
**

keep doing your best, keep doing what you know is needed from you.
**imposter syndrome will happen during it all, push through.
what is possible and what will happen is much more than what we expect or what we even know of.
** 

**why worry?

hello!
i am a first-year student at a university and i am looking for individuals to take a quick survey about happiness and some of the elements that affect it.
the only requirement is to be 18+.
the survey is anonymous and data will not be kept longer than 2 months.
the data will be used to achieve a better understanding behind the science of happiness.
link to the survey: [
it all starts with love.
it starts with following what makes you happy.
we can listen to what we are told to do but theres a high possibility that it will lead to regret in the future.
**follow your heart.
follow what you know is right for you.
**

with the ups and downs, the constant changes of life, the unexpected events, the universe etc., why waste this life on doing something just to please someone else?
**unlearning and relearning.
**

we will see what happen, but we don't even need to think, what, when, how, when, why, where we will be, we just have to keep doing our best to be.
**be right here, right now.
**

**take a step back.
realign.
come back even stronger.

the four noble truths of the buddha are simple to express: suffering is part of life, but happiness is possible and we make choices in every moment that lead us to happiness / suffering.
the reason its revolutionary is that it paints a picture where our happiness isn’t an external factor that's outside of our control, it’s something that’s within our reach with some practice, some patience and some persistence.
which is not to say that you should beat yourself up for not being happy - its as important to practice non-judgement for yourself as for others, because every person you see if doing the best they can given their circumstances, including you.
so how do we train ourselves to be happy?
the first step is to focus on the positive.
this might not be where our minds go automatically - humans have a natural negativity bias, a leftover from our our evolution where we’re more focused on where there might be wolves than where there’s flowers.
this is completely understandable as it kept us alive for thousands of years but its something we need to be aware of when living our modern lives.
social media is very focused on the negative because that’s what grabs our attention.
research shows that consuming any kind of media that is mostly negative affects our mental health.
so we need to be careful what we consume.
we can also make a choice in every moment to focus on the good things we have and be grateful for them rather than seeing what we don’t have or what’s wrong.
this takes time and patience as we might be very used to focusing on the negative.
i live in britain and we love to have a moan, especially about the weather but it’s within our gift to appreciate the great things that are all around and regularly meditate on them or capture them in a gratitude journal.
on the flip side can notice our judgmental thoughts arise, listen to them without getting involved or judging and watch them pass without acting on them.
this is how we train ourselves to focus on the positive.
the second step is smiling to your difficulties.
this sounds absolutely crazy - why would you want to smile when things are difficult?
there's two reasons - the first is neurological.
when you smile, even if you don’;t feel like smiling, your brain releases chemicals which reduce stress and lift your mood - so its a very easy way to change how you’re feeling.
that's why we gently smile while we meditate.
the other way smiling helps is that it reduces the power those difficulties have over you in your mind.
when we see anger, anxiety and sadness as our enemies that rob us of our peace then (naturally) we’re afraid of them - we try and block out the thoughts and we run to consumption to help us out, which of course never works in the long term.
when we smile to our difficulties, our difficult emotions and say, “there you are, my old friend”, we accept what we’re feeling without judgement, we reduce our suffering.

sergio mendes, at 79, released a new album, “in the key of joy,” and will no doubt resume touring (as he has done for decades) once the pandemic allows.
sergio’s masterful renditions, from the upbeat to the soulful, of his beloved brazilian rhythms, as well as those of jazz, are no surprise to those of us who grew up with “brazil 66.” but did you know that sergio originally trained to be a classical pianist?
it is only as sergio discovered jazz, just as bossa nova was becoming popular, that he turned his creativity to brazilian jazz, of which he is considered the undisputed master.

i’ve been trying to introduce as many people as possible to stoic philosophy and show them all of the things that i’ve learned from it.
one my absolute favorite pieces of this philosophy is the pursuit of supreme happiness, otherwise known as **eudaimonia.
**

eudaimonia translates to being on good terms with the highest version of yourself, which i’m positive is something i think we should all aspire to.
this concept is often represented as a triangle with 3 core aspect to it

1. live with areté - this is about being the best version of yourself and making choices accordingly
2. focus on what you can control - one of the fundamental tenets of stoic philosophy.
remember that we can’t change what already is, but we can choose what to do with the given circumstances.
3. take responsibility - in stoicism, it’s explained that it’s not an external situation that makes us happy or miserable, but our interpretation of that situation.
all 3 corners work hand in hand with each other to move you closer to a more fulfilling life of joy and satisfaction.
i explain this in depth here and describe how it has changed my life too - [

no matter what happens to us, we should **focus on what we control**, **take responsibility** for our judgment of the situation, and then **live with areté** by choosing to express our best self.
take a step back.
give yourself rest.
it all starts with 1 move.
1 move that is different than what we are used to.
1 move that then impacts, influences everything that we have ever even thought we had known.
**push forward.
** when we take a step back, we get launched forward, but sometimes we forget on how important it is to take a step back.
**dedication.
** i truly believe that we are all passionate with something, that we have many passions to focus on, but we are scared to start, why is that?
**imposter syndrome.
** 

this is something that i have been focusing on for the past months, but now i unlearn daily, to relearn whats right for me; **not to say that i don't still experience that daily, but it just means that i am now aware, slowly.
** 

self awareness is the beginning to the end.
**the end of what we have known and the beginning of what we need.

it seems to me a video that shows how we are manipulated by capitalism and how it leads us to consumerism through manipulation where it is seen how each person is infused that to be happy they must consume and be slaves to money and they do not realize that only they work for other superiors who are the ones who actually obtain economic benefits through us and at the same time power and well, in reality happiness is in people and what we share and provide us with human capital is happiness
though i know definitions are limiting and happiness is more like a delusion but still i want to know how would you want to define it in its literal meaning.

about five years ago i started regularly writing things i was grateful for in a journal.
i would write simple things that i was grateful for like waking up to the sun, all the way to specific/detailed things like the person's smile i encountered on a walk during the day which also made me smile.
i do this daily, and it's an instant way to set up my day to be in a good place.
before bed also is great as it sets up my subconscious to recognize the amazing things in life.
and from this experience, i created a fun little weekend project to help enhance my gratitude practice and i would love some beta users to try it out if anyone is interested!
it's a gratitude journal based in imessage, so it's not another app you need to download... you can try it free at [ would love to know your thoughts :)

** our thoughts, our actions and our intentions, the rest is none of our business.

as adult humans we’re expected to have aims to achieve and a plan to get there - this is perfectly normal and there’s nothing necessarily wrong with planning for the future.
but problems can arise when we get swept away by those plans and they result in us being stressed and unhappy in the present.
this can happen for three reasons.
the first is expecting ourselves to be perfect.
many people, including me, have perfectionist traits, making us feel as if you need to achieve or maximise your potential.
perfectionism and that attachment to never failing can be very harmful to your wellbeing and self-worth - if you train your awareness with regular practice then you can notice that feeling arising, breathe, take a step back, look deeply into it and tend to your perfectionism with compassion and understanding.
a second reason we get caught up in planning is that we attach our happiness to external factors like success, relationships and consumption.
we make a decision that we’ll be happy when we buy a house, get married, have kids, go on holiday, get a new job - you can think of a hundred things.
we can’t live happily in the future and human beings being what we are, when we get there and actually achieve the thing we’ve been thinking about for so long, the joy tends to be fleeting and can’t live up to how we’ve built it up in our heads.
of course we can enjoy these things in the present but attaching our wellbeing to them in the future sets us up for suffering.
the final reason we overplan is we’re are not noticing the joy and happiness in the world around us.
it’s a bit like watching a movie, knowing that the climax will be in the third act later on and not paying attention to the first hour and a half.
that sounds silly, but we frequently get caught up in the future and ignore what’s happening right now.
gratitude is a key practice in mindfulness and without training our awareness of the present moment we can miss the joy from the people in our life, the roof over your head, your pet dog, your lunch, the chair you’re sitting on.
if you find that your plans for the future take you away from the present and you’re always living in some other time and place, then consider letting go of the vision of the future that you’ve painted for yourself and think about it more as a direction you’re moving in rather than a destination.
that direction should be helpful to your mental health, it should help to build your peace and happiness rather than being built on consumption, achievement or rushing around.
please don’t take any of this as a judgement!
like you i get caught up in plans for the future and rushing around, we all do.
but sometimes we need to stop and taking a break from our striving so we can make aware, informed choices about whether our planning is really good for us or whether we need to breathe, relax and allow things to unfold in their own time.

self realisation - life’s greatest gift - philip wade interview

[

today i interview philip wade from gateway location.
philip attained a state of self-realisation many years ago and today he shares his experience with us and explains how self-realisation is open to each and every one of us as this is already our true self / our true nature….
“infinite silence is absolute, before time, before space, before concept, before the universal beingness of i am.
it is made manifest in infinite variety.
your form is like a facet of a diamond.
you are the facet and the whole diamond at once!
infinite silence is that which you truly are!
your divine essence.
it is absolute and the animating principle of all that is.
is = infinite silence”.

we have our own thoughts, opinions, whats "**right**", whats "**wrong**"?
its actually what is right/wrong for us.
it will always be different to what someone else thinks.
as long as we as beings aren't **transphobic, homophobic, racist;** then we can all have different opinions of different experiences.
**reflect, refresh, transform.
** each day we experience new moments; **moments we never even knew were needed, that we encounter.
** 

**release expectations.
** i have been trying my best in the past months to release expectations because we truly don't know how anything is going to happen, **all we have is this present moment.
we live on.

some days are easier than others, some days are tougher, its all for our greatness.

a few weeks back i posted my [happiness spreadsheet]( for anyone interested in tracking their daily happiness.
in doing my monthly happiness review this month, i wanted to visualize my happiness even more than the spreadsheet has to offer.
i was able to find a nice google chart data visualization that can take all of my calendar and happiness data and turn it into something useful.
here is the result:



i am a visual person, so i pumped to be able to really look at my happiness in this way.
i never had a lot of red/bad days to begin with, but i am glad to see that most of my bad days are becoming fewer and farther spaced apart.
plus, there are becoming less white days as well.
if every day can turn into a green…well now i am really onto something!
for me, tracking happiness by giving it a value has helped me to *emphasize my happiness* day after day:

* i make better choices.
* i start each day fresh.
* i chose to do more things that make me happy.
* i chose to be more present in the moment (because that makes me happier).
* i chose to do things to make others happy, because i now realize that it makes me happier as well.
hopefully i have convinced one or two of you to track your happiness and if you are interested in learning more, please check out my full update and real-time visualization here: [
just read this article and it made me reflect:  

i liked it but not only because of the program itself but because it made me reflect on my happiness.
it is true that we focus on many things that indirectly make us happy, but many times we wonder why we are not entirely happy, if we need something to happen in our life, a new love, a new job, etc.
but we never look for the answer in ourselves.
i hope you enjoy this article and that we normalize practicing joy for ourselves :)
open space to do anything.
it takes time and needs to have hard work with it.
anything is possible, for any place in the world, if someone tells you it isn't then, thats their own **insecurities.
** 

**it is easier to project than to do the inside work, remember that.
**

do the internal work.
there will be lots of ups and downs, there will be lots of moments where you may ask yourself **"why me?
"**, because trust me, **i do.
**

**i know though, that everything i have experienced so far; pain, trauma, depression, anxiety, fear, happiness, joy, healing, is for something greater, as for you.
**

keep going &amp; continue to **follow your heart.
** the world needs it from you, as it does from me.
**the toughest obstacles will allow ourselves to build the resilience we need to open doors, we didn't know we needed.
**

**ride the wave.
**

**i love you.

still waters after a long and rocky ocean with treacherous waves.
we all get to the point where everything is ok, but wasn't everything always?
everything has always been the same way its been but has naturally evolved through our day to day.
our day to day focus, our day to day grind, we continue.
with the ups and downs of life that we have **all** faced in the past year, its truly amazing how much we can do, when we are in our own spaces and truly shows us that we can do more than what we believe, if we have a little **faith.

**non-judgment** - paying attention to your opinions as they arise.
jkz talks about how the human mind sorts things into boxes - good, bad, neutral.
by taking a perspective of non-judgement and being aware we can take the most joy from the good things, accept the bad things (doing us less harm), and become more aware of the neutral things, realising how much they contribute to our lives.
of course judgmental thoughts still arise but we can simply observe them and let them pass without acting on them.
**patience** - letting things unfold in their own time.
meditation isn’t difficult to learn but it does require patience and persistence.
it takes some time to see the benefits of it, you need to stick with it.
doing it once a week is helpful but when you make time for a little bit of practice every day for six weeks the evidence shows its actually rewiring how your brain works, you’re training yourself to be happy.
its also about being patience with ourselves, not setting expectations for achieving a standard in a specific time, and being patient with others who have lived their life through a set of circumstances we’re not aware of.
**beginners mind** - seeing the world as if for the first time and seeing the infinite possibilities.
knowledge can limit our perception of what we don’t know, part of becoming wise (rather than clever) is getting comfortable with what we don’t know.
when we accumulate a lot of knowledge and become jaded by experience we can lose touch with the joy in our lives.
**trust** - listening to our bodies and our senses.
trusting that if we let go of anxieties about the future and regrets from the past and live in the present that everything will be ok - because it really will.
when we cultivate trust in ourselves through practice, when we build our calmness and peace and live in the present moment  we start to trust other people more because we’re not jumping ahead to what they might do or questioning their motives - we’re existing in the present taking their words and actions at face value.
really listening to other people with an open mind is when we make strong human connections.
**non-striving** - we’re always trying to get somewhere, always running toward a destination.
but an important aspect of mindfulness is realising that you have arrived in the here and now.
we can’t live happily in the future; if everything we’re doing is to achieve, we sacrifice our wellbeing in the present.
we tell ourselves we’ll be happy when we get promoted, we get married, we have kids, when we retire.
this is the only time we can be happy - mindfulness is called the art of stopping, sometimes we have to ease off with the future plans and enjoy where we are and who we’re with.
**acceptance** - accepting that things are the way they are.
which is not to say you don’t do anything about it, the idea is that you are aware in the present moment, you see things as they are and you can decide what it is you want to do.
there’s a myth that mindfulness somehow makes you ok with injustice and suffering - the opposite is true!
when we accept the world in front of us, accept people, accept yourself, you can act out of emotional intelligence and compassion rather than anger or fear.
**letting go** - by identifying the attachments we have we can trace the roots of our anger, our fear, our sadness and understand why we react the way we do in certain circumstances.
once we apply our awareness to our attachments we can start to understand ourselves, we can start to feel compassion for ourselves, then we can start to let go of our suffering.

my friends, 

life is not about whats at the end of the road or the final goal.
true happiness is found in the simplicity of living.
a walk around the block, the sun shining with a cool breeze hitting your face.
a nice fresh cup of coffee in the morning ( or any time of day lol).
don't get me wrong getting that new car or finally going on that nice vacation is fantastic as well, but ignoring the small little things we are so fortunate to enjoy everyday you essentially waste a fantastic life.
with it being easter weekend for some i just want you all to enjoy life and be the happiest &amp; best individual one can be.
enjoy the little things ✊
blue sky.
sunshine.
the wind, the birds, the sounds, the smells and the feelings of spring that are close.
the moments of stepping away from what is known, may sometimes push our comfort zones &amp; make us feel uncomfortable.
push through.
the change comes from inside, the change takes time from learned experiences, from pain, trauma, joy, sunshine, and time.
on the journey of life, change will constantly happen to us.
change is the **sole** thing that we will continue to have to face, welcome in and be comfortable with the uncomfortable feelings.
keep pushing.
keep doing your best.
**i love you.

new start, new beginning.
internal pains, now turn into internal strengths.
in the moments of trials and tribulations its about knowing that this is all for something greater than what we know.
grey sky, warm air, cold air, blue sky.
we push on.
everything is competition, we have been conditioned to think this way, **this is only conditioning.
the world shouldn't be like this.
thats why i am so excited for this new nft space.
collaboration versus competition.
** 

**we now come together.
**

through what we have known in the art world, its always been battling, which then detriments our own mental health, creates anxiety, scarcity, pressures to constantly perform, create and innovate.
**when we create with sole love and patience, those emotions get released and we then create with purpose.

we say one thing and then don't believe in it.
**less talking, more doing.
** here we are.
in the 21st century, living our life as we please, as we choose to.
remember that we have all the capabilities to live the life we want to, by doing what we want to, the only thing is, is that we have to have a deep level of **patience, persistence, dedication, consistency and work ethic.
** remember though, we will have to work hard either way to make it through this life, **it will be for someone else or it will be for ourself, with us working for someone else for a brief time, which do you choose?
**

i chose working for someone for a brief moment, while **working fucking hard with what i love to do.
here, i am.
its possible.
everyone can do it.
** 

i believe that every single human being is multifaceted, that every human being can do multiple things, **i don't believe that certain people are "chosen", i believe that once we start following our heart, thats when the universe will "choose" us to move forward.

here is my experience with d.o.s.e method for practicing joy by daybreaker :).
i hope you like it: [
the power of the wind.
the power of nature.
the power of following our heart.
through the stillness of being, through the stillness of enjoying the moment, we are then allowed to receive what has been waiting to come to us.
seasons change, from snow to rain to sunshine, we bloom.
blooming will constantly be different then what we expect.
it will be met with having to face experiences that push our comfort zones, push our boundaries, we will meet fear, anxiety and many other emotions.
**its all for our higher being.
**

these past months have been challenging but i know that with challenging moments, there is growth near, there is peace near, there is abundance near.
how, when?
**thats out of my control, i will continue to just be and i hope you do so as well.

**today:** listen to this weeks podcast **"morning gratitude"** episode 26 and let me know your takeaways.
**i love you.

change is inevitable.
change will happen either way, if we want it or not.
we as the human must be open to the change.
the change is where we will find our true self, lose a part of our self that is no longer needed, what is needed though is the will to keep going.
over the past year of my life, and all of our lives, change was forced onto us, we didn't choose to be where we are now, nor did we even know that it was going to happen, **we changed.
change happens if we want it or not.
**

**i am proud of us.
some days may be difficult, but what am i learning is that the struggle comes from the eye of the beholder not from the actual situation itself.
watching rather than judging.
taking a step back when needed, instead of rushing in.
rushing in when we feel like we need to.
**

life changes &amp; when it does, that is the universe showing us that we are ready for that change, the sole thing **we have to do, is embrace it.
do so, life will get good after.
**

**i love you.

fred paul, at 84, and florence harvey, at 81, once again found the love they thought they had lost forever.
fred and florence had been high school sweethearts lo these many years ago in the small town of wandsworth, canada.
after high school, fred left for a job in toronto.
when he came back a year later, florence no longer lived in wandsworth and fred couldn’t find her.
each of them went on to have good marriages with others.
yet after florence’s husband passed away and she discovered fred’s wife passed away, florence found a way to connect with fred, mainly to reassure him that things would get better over time.
well, one phone call turned into hours of phone calls, into finally meeting up together, and within 3 days (wait for it) – getting married!
such is the power of love.
rain outside.
pouring.
grey sky.
i feel at peace.
i feel calm.
lack of sleep but thats ok, i can catch up tonight.
**i can't catch up on opportunities.
**

we live a life that we experience many different emotions, light, pain, love, struggle, **its all our choice on our perspective.
we are love.
**

with the change of seasons, the warm weather is on the way, i love the cold weather &amp; the snow, but lets be real, **i love spring, summer and everything that blooms in the warmer months.
** 

**we have to go through the rain, through the planting of our foundation to get a point where we bloom.
**

**have patience, it will work out.

**i love you.

lasting peace and happiness - jolene o’brien interview

[

today i interview jolene o’brien from (peace &amp; love uk).
jolene had a realization of the self some years ago, today she explains her journey of awakening from deep suffering into a lasting peace.
jolene explains how we too can attain this realization and finally bring an end to all mental pain and suffering - to finally attain everlasting peace &amp; happiness…

\#joleneobrien #peaceandlove #happinessnow #interview #selfrealization
for the last couple years, i have been on a journey to **test and tweak various methods to track and improve my own happiness**.
at first this started off with asking "what is the favorite part of your day?"
at the dinner table.
expressing more gratitude certainly helped.
then this lead to actually tracking my **top 3 moments of the day** and writing them down in the notes app on my phone.
finally, i was listening to the tim ferriss show's interview of jim collins.
and turns out that **jim has the perfect method for tracking happiness**.
he gives each day a score and tracks that score over time.
his scale is as follows.
* 2 is a great day
* 1 is a good day
* 0 is a so-so day
* \-1 is a bad day
* \-2 is a really bad day

after using this system for the past few years, i can say that it works.
**it helps me to better gage my happiness levels**, and focus on doing the things that make me the happiest in my daily life.
is every day great?
no.
but i am starting to **improve my days simply by giving each day a score**.
my full and expanded article on "how to track your happiness"  is here: [  


if you are interested in tracking your happiness, please check out this post, which explains how the tracker works and has a link to download:

***happy happiness tracking everyone!
***
it seems everywhere these days there are lists and books of "10 things you can do every day to be happy".
socialising, walking in nature, doing fitness, etc etc etc.. but to me these things seem surface candy-floss 'sugar highs' only.
they don't really do it for me.
they don't leave a lasting effect.
they don't move me into a state of 'wanting to be alive'.
i wondered if anyone else felt the same way?
hi reddit,

just been feeling down lately.
never ending work routine, no private space to cool down, and constant hussle to save and survive.
it just seems like it will never end.
how do people re-charge and power through their days?
seeking some unique motivation / happiness that will super charge me.
just feels like there's more than this in my life...

welcome any feedback / suggestions / thoughts :)

thank you
 
this years report has just been issued.
it always makes an interesting read and this year, with the impact of corona, is even more thought provoking i thought.
it starts with ourself.
it starts with giving what we need for ourself.
**i always thought it was the other way around.
i used to think that if i am there for others before myself then i will receive energy, healing and abundance.
i have learned.
i learned that i was solely checking in on others due to subconsciously projecting my insecurities onto others.
i now put myself first in the early morning.
**

i have learned that when i fill my cup first, that i am able to give more to others &amp; imposter syndrome still tries to overwhelm, swarm and make me believe that its different.
**keep pushing.
** 

**everyday is a new day to our best &amp; thats all we can do.
** 

in a world where there is so much opportunity, in a world where we can continue to innovate, to try new things, **we have to remember that everything takes time.
that everything is a process, that we can only do as much as we can.
** if there are new things that you want to focus on but can't find the time, then take a step back and ask yourself, **"am i doing the most that i can right now?"
yes.
** 

**keep going, keep pushing.
**

**i love you.

have you had an anxious over-reaction when something goes wrong -  you might think that if a relationship ends you’ll never find someone else, if you fail an exam you can never have a successful career.
you’re imagining all the terrible things that are going to happen, it feels like the world is ending and the house of cards is falling apart.
so what’s happening in our heads?
the first thing that’s going awry is that we’re living in the hereafter.
as humans we can’t live with happiness and calmness in the future - we can only live a joyful life in the present.
when we notice our minds are moving into the future we can stop, we can breath and we can focus on something in the present - maybe our breath, our surroundings or an activity.
as well as living in the future, we’re predicting the worst possible outcomes - out of all the things that could possibly happen, our minds naturally go to the catastrophe.
that's not something to worry about in itself - everyone has catastrophic thoughts and it kept us alive when human beings had to contend with predators and danger.
you probably don’t see a lot of wolves and tigers so we can give ourselves permission to take a step back and think it through.
when catastrophic thinking arises we need to be aware enough to notice the thought and ask ourselves whether it’s really true or realistic.
if it isn’t we can allow the thought to pass out of awareness, without being swept away and without any harm or damage to us.
a third driver of catastrophic thinking is the belief that you can’t cope with whatever outcome you’re afraid of, that you’ll somehow fall apart.
monsters live in the dark, so shine the light of awareness on it - you’ve coped with difficult experiences in the past and you have a much greater reserve of strength and resilience than you’re aware of.
everyone experiences catastrophic thoughts, its natural and part of who we are - but our reaction to them decides whether they cause us suffering or they pass without harming us.
life is full of challenges as well as good and bad days; just because one day is bad does not mean all days will be bad.
one final thing to bear in mind is that is that we catastrophize more when we’re anxious and our mental health is poor, so get a regular wellbeing routine in place with a little meditation and awareness every day.

hey guys any ideas, activities that can make you feel happier
its easier to project, its easier to keep it moving on the outside.
the tough work comes from inside.
it comes from going deep inside.
its interesting to me how we as humans know that its the best for us to follow and focus on how we feel inside but we still try to push them away.
i remember growing up and feeling feels about what now is my identity at the surface and thinking **"oh, i will grow out of it",** i look back and laugh with joy how naive i was.
when things are meant for us, when theres changes that need to be made with ourself, with our path, which is ultimately all for our path, we can continue to battle by self induced numbing, to think they will go away, or things will change, but we are just digging a deeper hole, but sometimes its needed for a given amount of time.
**its about realizing how we work as the individual, not what someone is telling us on the internet, lol not even me.
we can listen though and take what is given and transform it into our own way with what we have experienced and lived with to this moment.
**

**do whats right for you.
the world needs it.
**

**i love you.
