So if you have a lot of ideas of happiness I would also recommend to write down all these ideas on a piece of paper. Now you have written down everything, let everything go.

        "19":"What's the most admirable trait in a person in your opinion. Fearlessness would probably be at the top of my list",
        "20":"Work\u2019s a tough place to be mindful as it sometimes feels you\u2019re rushing from one thing to another. Sometimes that rushing can mean that we\u2019re either worrying about the future or regretting the past, picking over things that haven\u2019t gone as well as we hoped. How do we make work a happy place to be?\n\nAn obvious place to start is relationships and communication. When things are busy and we\u2019re feeling anxious, that's when our stress behaviours can surface. We\u2019re less aware of how other people are feeling and of the impact that we have on other people which can sometimes mean we that can say things we later regret. If we train ourselves to be aware when we\u2019re starting to get stressed out, we can breathe, notice the feeling and tend to our anxiety and anger with kindness. We can prioritise what we\u2019re doing - is everything that you\u2019re doing a must do? Can other people help us? The Plum Village app has a timer with a bell that chimes every so often so you can check in with your breath, your body, your thoughts and your feelings. Awareness is the cornerstone of tending to your stress with compassion.\n\nListening is also incredibly important and powerful in the workplace. We sometimes get caught up in the \u2018doing\u2019 completely and forget that building relationships is how big change happens. We\u2019re social animals and we have a bigger impact together, so to do this we need to build deep connections. When we listen to someone with our full awareness, without judging and without jumping to conclusions it\u2019s a genuine act of kindness, particularly if that person is having a difficult time. Deep listening is even more important when we disagree - understanding why someone feels the way they do isn\u2019t the same as agreeing with them and its critical to resolve conflict. Frequently when we feel stressed in work it\u2019s because we don\u2019t feel listened to so it\u2019s important to find people that you can express how you\u2019re feeling to. It\u2019s reasonable to expect your line manager to listen with understanding and respect - it\u2019s part of their role.\n\nAnother cause of stress at work is placing pressure on ourselves to get everything right first time and this obviously isn\u2019t realistic, especially if you\u2019re starting a new job. Failure is part of life and key to learning - when something doesn\u2019t go as well as we hoped, its not helpful to point fingers, especially at ourselves. The important thing is to learn, apply, grow and move on. I think as human beings for some reason we keep a book in our head of all the mistakes we ever made. If you\u2019ve learned from the mistake then it\u2019s time to let it go - if you feel your mind bringing out the book of doom and leafing through then rather than being swept away to regrets from the past you can smile to the book and let your mind put it back on the shelf.\n\nAnd finally what might be the most important, which is looking after each other. When we lift our head up from everyday tasks we can sometimes see that other people are suffering and it\u2019s important not to be a bystander. Checking in on people by asking if they\u2019re OK makes a huge difference - if you think that the wellbeing culture in your workplace isn\u2019t where it needs to be, just be aware that you have much more influence than you think. Just by asking the question of what we want our workplace to be can open a conversation that makes a huge difference to making work a happy, safe and fulfilling place - which is what it should be.\n\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/manifesto-for-a-kinder-workplace\/id1493806566?i=1000519594684)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https:\/\/www.google.com\/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/shaun-donaghy\/episodes\/Manifesto-for-a-kinder-workplace-e101nir)",
        "21":"We rush through life.

He's the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, a Nobel Prize winner, and a hugely sought-after speaker and statesman. Why is he so popular? Even after spending only a few minutes in his presence you can't help feeling happier.\n\nIf you ask him if he's happy, even though he's suffered the loss of his country, the Dalai Lama will give you an unconditional yes. What's more, he'll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that the very motion of our life is toward happiness. How to get there has always been the question. He's tried to answer it before, but he's never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand.\n\nThe Art of Happiness is the book that started the genre of happiness books, and it remains the cornerstone of the field of positive psychology.\n\nThrough conversations, stories, and meditations, the Dalai Lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement. Together with Dr. Howard Cutler, he explores many facets of everyday life, including relationships, loss, and the pursuit of wealth, to illustrate how to ride through life's obstacles on a deep and abiding source of inner peace. Based on 2,500 years of Buddhist meditations mixed with a healthy dose of common sense, The Art of Happiness is a book that crosses the boundaries of traditions to help readers with difficulties common to all human beings. After being in print for ten years, this book has touched countless lives and uplifted spirits around the world.",

        "30":"The four noble truths of the Buddha are simple to express: suffering is part of life, but happiness is possible and we make choices in every moment that lead us to happiness \/ suffering. The reason its revolutionary is that it paints a picture where our happiness isn\u2019t an external factor that's outside of our control, it\u2019s something that\u2019s within our reach with some practice, some patience and some persistence.\n\nWhich is not to say that you should beat yourself up for not being happy - its as important to practice non-judgement for yourself as for others, because every person you see if doing the best they can given their circumstances, including you.\n\nSo how do we train ourselves to be happy? The first step is to focus on the positive.  This might not be where our minds go automatically - humans have a natural negativity bias, a leftover from our our evolution where we\u2019re more focused on where there might be wolves than where there\u2019s flowers. This is completely understandable as it kept us alive for thousands of years but its something we need to be aware of when living our modern lives. Social media is very focused on the negative because that\u2019s what grabs our attention. Research shows that consuming any kind of media that is mostly negative affects our mental health. So we need to be careful what we consume.\n\nWe can also make a choice in every moment to focus on the good things we have and be grateful for them rather than seeing what we don\u2019t have or what\u2019s wrong. This takes time and patience as we might be very used to focusing on the negative. I live in Britain and we love to have a moan, especially about the weather but it\u2019s within our gift to appreciate the great things that are all around and regularly meditate on them or capture them in a gratitude journal. On the flip side can notice our judgmental thoughts arise, listen to them without getting involved or judging and watch them pass without acting on them. This is how we train ourselves to focus on the positive.\n\nThe second step is smiling to your difficulties. This sounds absolutely crazy - why would you want to smile when things are difficult? There's two reasons - the first is neurological. When you smile, even if you don\u2019;t feel like smiling, your brain releases chemicals which reduce stress and lift your mood - so its a very easy way to change how you\u2019re feeling. That's why we gently smile while we meditate.\n\nThe other way smiling helps is that it reduces the power those difficulties have over you in your mind. When we see anger, anxiety and sadness as our enemies that rob us of our peace then (naturally) we\u2019re afraid of them - we try and block out the thoughts and we run to consumption to help us out, which of course never works in the long term. When we smile to our difficulties, our difficult emotions and say, \u201cthere you are, my old friend\u201d, we accept what we\u2019re feeling without judgement, we reduce our suffering.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/training-yourself-to-be-happy\/id1493806566?i=1000518442780)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https:\/\/www.google.com\/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/shaun-donaghy\/episodes\/Training-yourself-to-be-happy-evial3)",

        "65":"As adult humans we\u2019re expected to have aims to achieve and a plan to get there - this is perfectly normal and there\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with planning for the future. But problems can arise when we get swept away by those plans and they result in us being stressed and unhappy in the present. This can happen for three reasons.\n\nThe first is expecting ourselves to be perfect. Many people, including me, have perfectionist traits, making us feel as if you need to achieve or maximise your potential. Perfectionism and that attachment to never failing can be very harmful to your wellbeing and self-worth - if you train your awareness with regular practice then you can notice that feeling arising, breathe, take a step back, look deeply into it and tend to your perfectionism with compassion and understanding.\n\nA second reason we get caught up in planning is that we attach our happiness to external factors like success, relationships and consumption. We make a decision that we\u2019ll be happy when we buy a house, get married, have kids, go on holiday, get a new job - you can think of a hundred things. We can\u2019t live happily in the future and human beings being what we are, when we get there and actually achieve the thing we\u2019ve been thinking about for so long, the joy tends to be fleeting and can\u2019t live up to how we\u2019ve built it up in our heads. Of course we can enjoy these things in the present but attaching our wellbeing to them in the future sets us up for suffering.\n\nThe final reason we overplan is we\u2019re are not noticing the joy and happiness in the world around us. It\u2019s a bit like watching a movie, knowing that the climax will be in the third act later on and not paying attention to the first hour and a half. That sounds silly, but we frequently get caught up in the future and ignore what\u2019s happening right now. Gratitude is a key practice in mindfulness and without training our awareness of the present moment we can miss the joy from the people in our life, the roof over your head, your pet dog, your lunch, the chair you\u2019re sitting on. \n\nIf you find that your plans for the future take you away from the present and you\u2019re always living in some other time and place, then consider letting go of the vision of the future that you\u2019ve painted for yourself and think about it more as a direction you\u2019re moving in rather than a destination. That direction should be helpful to your mental health, it should help to build your peace and happiness rather than being built on consumption, achievement or rushing around.\n\nPlease don\u2019t take any of this as a judgement! Like you I get caught up in plans for the future and rushing around, we all do. But sometimes we need to stop and taking a break from our striving so we can make aware, informed choices about whether our planning is really good for us or whether we need to breathe, relax and allow things to unfold in their own time.\n\n[Listen for more](link.chtbl.com\/8mIXYPFV)",

        "88":"**Non-judgment** - paying attention to your opinions as they arise. JKZ talks about how the human mind sorts things into boxes - good, bad, neutral. By taking a perspective of non-judgement and being aware we can take the most joy from the good things, accept the bad things (doing us less harm), and become more aware of the neutral things, realising how much they contribute to our lives. Of course judgmental thoughts still arise but we can simply observe them and let them pass without acting on them.\n\n\n**Patience** - letting things unfold in their own time. Meditation isn\u2019t difficult to learn but it does require patience and persistence. It takes some time to see the benefits of it, you need to stick with it. Doing it once a week is helpful but when you make time for a little bit of practice every day for six weeks the evidence shows its actually rewiring how your brain works, you\u2019re training yourself to be happy. Its also about being patience with ourselves, not setting expectations for achieving a standard in a specific time, and being patient with others who have lived their life through a set of circumstances we\u2019re not aware of. \n\n\n**Beginners mind** - seeing the world as if for the first time and seeing the infinite possibilities. Knowledge can limit our perception of what we don\u2019t know, part of becoming wise (rather than clever) is getting comfortable with what we don\u2019t know. When we accumulate a lot of knowledge and become jaded by experience we can lose touch with the joy in our lives.\n\n\n**Trust** - listening to our bodies and our senses. Trusting that if we let go of anxieties about the future and regrets from the past and live in the present that everything will be OK - because it really will. When we cultivate trust in ourselves through practice, when we build our calmness and peace and live in the present moment  we start to trust other people more because we\u2019re not jumping ahead to what they might do or questioning their motives - we\u2019re existing in the present taking their words and actions at face value. Really listening to other people with an open mind is when we make strong human connections. \n\n\n**Non-striving** - we\u2019re always trying to get somewhere, always running toward a destination. But an important aspect of mindfulness is realising that you have arrived in the here and now. We can\u2019t live happily in the future; if everything we\u2019re doing is to achieve, we sacrifice our wellbeing in the present. We tell ourselves we\u2019ll be happy when we get promoted, we get married, we have kids, when we retire. This is the only time we can be happy - mindfulness is called the art of stopping, sometimes we have to ease off with the future plans and enjoy where we are and who we\u2019re with.\n\n\n**Acceptance** - accepting that things are the way they are. Which is not to say you don\u2019t do anything about it, the idea is that you are aware in the present moment, you see things as they are and you can decide what it is you want to do. There\u2019s a myth that mindfulness somehow makes you OK with injustice and suffering - the opposite is true! When we accept the world in front of us, accept people, accept yourself, you can act out of emotional intelligence and compassion rather than anger or fear. \n\n\n**Letting go** - by identifying the attachments we have we can trace the roots of our anger, our fear, our sadness and understand why we react the way we do in certain circumstances. Once we apply our awareness to our attachments we can start to understand ourselves, we can start to feel compassion for ourselves, then we can start to let go of our suffering.\n\n\n[Listen for more](https:\/\/link.chtbl.com\/tDsqppjK)",

Fred and Florence had been high school sweethearts lo these many years ago in the small town of Wandsworth, Canada. After high school, Fred left for a job in Toronto. When he came back a year later, Florence no longer lived in Wandsworth and Fred couldn\u2019t find her. Each of them went on to have good marriages with others. Yet after Florence\u2019s husband passed away and she discovered Fred\u2019s wife passed away, Florence found a way to connect with Fred, mainly to reassure him that things would get better over time. Well, one phone call turned into hours of phone calls, into finally meeting up together, and within 3 days (wait for it) \u2013 getting married! Such is the power of love.",

Expressing more gratitude certainly helped.   \n\n\nThen this lead to actually tracking my **Top 3 moments of the day** and writing them down in the notes app on my phone.   \n\n\nFinally, I was listening to the Tim Ferriss Show's interview of Jim Collins. And turns out that **Jim has the perfect method for tracking happiness**. He gives each day a score and tracks that score over time. His scale is as follows.   \n\n\n* 2 is a great day\n* 1 is a good day\n* 0 is a so-so day\n* \\-1 is a bad day\n* \\-2 is a really bad day\n\nAfter using this system for the past few years, I can say that it works. **It helps me to better gage my happiness levels**, and focus on doing the things that make ME the happiest in my daily life. Is every day great? No. But I am starting to **improve my days simply by giving each day a score**.   \n\n\nMy full and expanded article on \"How to track your happiness\"  is here: [https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/enjoying-life\/how-to-track-your-happiness\/170](https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/enjoying-life\/how-to-track-your-happiness\/170)  \n\n\nIf you are interested in tracking your happiness, please check out this post, which explains how the tracker works and has a link to download: \n\n[https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/resources\/happiness-tracker-spreadsheet\/502](https:\/\/accidentallyretired.com\/resources\/happiness-tracker-spreadsheet\/502)\n\n***Happy Happiness tracking everyone!***",

        "118":"Have you had an anxious over-reaction when something goes wrong -  you might think that if a relationship ends you\u2019ll never find someone else, if you fail an exam you can never have a successful career. You\u2019re imagining all the terrible things that are going to happen, it feels like the world is ending and the house of cards is falling apart. \n\nSo what\u2019s happening in our heads? The first thing that\u2019s going awry is that we\u2019re living in the hereafter. As humans we can\u2019t live with happiness and calmness in the future - we can only live a joyful life in the present. When we notice our minds are moving into the future we can stop, we can breath and we can focus on something in the present - maybe our breath, our surroundings or an activity.\n\nAs well as living in the future, we\u2019re predicting the worst possible outcomes - out of all the things that could possibly happen, our minds naturally go to the catastrophe. That's not something to worry about in itself - everyone has catastrophic thoughts and it kept us alive when human beings had to contend with predators and danger. \n\nYou probably don\u2019t see a lot of wolves and tigers so we can give ourselves permission to take a step back and think it through. When catastrophic thinking arises we need to be aware enough to notice the thought and ask ourselves whether it\u2019s really true or realistic. If it isn\u2019t we can allow the thought to pass out of awareness, without being swept away and without any harm or damage to us.\n\nA third driver of catastrophic thinking is the belief that you can\u2019t cope with whatever outcome you\u2019re afraid of, that you\u2019ll somehow fall apart. Monsters live in the dark, so shine the light of awareness on it - you\u2019ve coped with difficult experiences in the past and you have a much greater reserve of strength and resilience than you\u2019re aware of.\n\nEveryone experiences catastrophic thoughts, its natural and part of who we are - but our reaction to them decides whether they cause us suffering or they pass without harming us. Life is full of challenges as well as good and bad days; just because one day is bad does not mean all days will be bad. \n\nOne final thing to bear in mind is that is that we catastrophize more when we\u2019re anxious and our mental health is poor, so get a regular wellbeing routine in place with a little meditation and awareness every day.\n\n[Listen On Apple Podcasts](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/catastrophizing-how-to-stop-worrying-pt2\/id1493806566?i=1000513762561)\n\n[Listen On Google Podcasts](https:\/\/www.google.com\/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8xMjNkZThlMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw==)\n\n[Listen On Spotify](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1ozwIEgzEtHQezPoi83nVV)\n\n[Other ways to listen](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/shaun-donaghy\/episodes\/Catastrophizing---how-to-stop-worrying-pt2-et2qr5)",

It comes from going deep inside. \n\nIts interesting to me how we as humans know that its the best for us to follow and focus on how we feel inside but we still try to push them away. I remember growing up and feeling feels about what now is my identity at the surface and thinking **\"oh, I will grow out of it\",** I look back and laugh with joy how naive I was. \n\nWhen things are meant for us, when theres changes that need to be made with ourself, with our path, which is ultimately all for our path, we can continue to battle by self induced numbing, to think they will go away, or things will change, but we are just digging a deeper hole, but sometimes its needed for a given amount of time. \n\n**Its about realizing how we work as the individual, not what someone is telling us on the internet, lol not even me.
