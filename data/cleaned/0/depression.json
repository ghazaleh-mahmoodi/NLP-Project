        "0":"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \n\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at \/r\/depression\/wiki\/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the \/r\/depression and \/r\/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt\/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",
        "1":"Welcome to \/r\/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\nWe try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under \"Community Info\" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.  \n\n********\n\n**Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.**  \n\nIt's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  *Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.*\n\n*****\n\n**Despite the fact that we always maintain a sticky post about it, we're still seeing a lot of violations of the private contact policy.  Please read \/r\/depression\/wiki\/private_contact and report any violations that you see.**  Widespread disregard of this important rule causes trouble for both helpers and vulnerable OPs, wastes our time, and delays the improvements we're making to the community resources.",

        "4":"I was at school yesterday and started having a panic attack because I was remember what BAS did to me and sometimes it feels like I can feel it happening all over again. I wasn't really able to handle it so I decided to go to the counselors office. It took me a while but eventually I was able to tell them I was sexually assaulted. It was really hard to get the words to form in my mouth, it felt wrong but I managed. I knew they'd tell my parents and the police. I talked to an officer at my school and told him a bit about it, I refused to say what exactly happened and I also refused to give them their names. They called my mom and told her, I really just felt numb the whole time. I have to go to an interview with some other police officer, they want me to tell them what exactly happened but I dont know that I can..\nMy mom told my grandma when I got home and I didn't feel anything. I didn't say it so it wasn't that bad. I can see how they look at me differently, the sorrow in their eyes. If I focus on it it hurts so I just tried to avoid eye contact. I don't know, it won't leave my head even more than usual. I feel awful and distant. I dont know. I figured people would want an update so yea, here you go. Any advice or anything would be appreciated. Thank you for reading this far and I hope you have a nice rest of you day\/evening",

For instance I watch spiritual videos sometimes and they will say a spirit communicated that the timing was right. Directly after they say \u201cexcept for cases of suicide\u201d. Sorry but that makes no sense. If you have an urge to go driving and accidentally get in a car crash and die how is that different from the urge to go driving and crash because you purposely wanted to end your life? I personally don\u2019t think it makes any sense that suicide death would be any different from anything else. I\u2019m just a religious person trying to understand why things happen and I don\u2019t see why suicide would be someone abandoning their destiny. If everyone has a set path , then they won\u2019t leave that path.",
        "8":"Just a random thought I just had, really. I probably have depression, and I really really hate myself. But I also find myself fantasizing about having a girlfriend more and more, like, I'm starting to actively WANT to be in a relationship.\n\nBut the thing is, I also tried to follow the rule of \" loving yourself before you try to love someone else \" for a long time. And yeah, how could I actually love someone if I don't like myself ?\n\nI don't know. It's like I am not even sure what it is I truly want. Do I :\nA : Actually want someone to love \nor B : Do I just want to stop feeling lonely ? Do I just want to use a person to fill a void in my life ?\n\nAs much as I would love to believe it's the first option, the truth is it's probably the second one. And it makes me feel like such a scumbag, wanting to use people. And I hate myself even more.\n\nBut even if I know all this, at the end of the day, the desire of wanting a girlfriend is still here. So yeah. It's a vicious circle.\n\nTo some extent, it even applies to my friends, are my feelings of love and admiration for them genuine ? Or do I just like the fact that being with them is the only thing that makes me happy ?\n\nHow can you be so fucked up you don't even know how you, yourself feel about things anymore ?",

I\u2019ve felt sad for as long as I can remember and there was a lot of problems at home when I was younger which probably didn\u2019t help.\nI don\u2019t like feeling like this and I wish it would go away. Sometimes feels like I\u2019m detached from the rest of the world and I\u2019m just looking in at it from a glass window.

Also wrote this on mobile so sorry for the format and mistakes \n\nNote: I posted this on r\/suicidewatch just now as well, and figured that this would probably be a community that would resonate with some of what I said here too.\n\n\nI'm tired of living my life. I feel like I've tried so many different times to change who I am. To catch up. To be a person who can speak coherently. To be a person who can be interested in things and put effort into them. To be a person who takes care of themselves. To be a person at all really. Haven't gotten anywhere in what feels years.\n\nFor context, I used to be pretty happy and on a good track when I was really young (4-10 years old). I had good friends, did well in school etc, but then I had to be fucking stupid and prioritize video games\/internet over everything else. I started pretending I was sick and did everything I could during 5th grade to stay home and be on my computer, and for some reason, be it anxiety or charitablility\/empathy, my mom played into it and let me do it. Eventually, It got out of control and there was a period where I got pneumonia and lobbied my parents to let me stay home for weeks which put me in a shitty position with the school I was going to. But that's okay! My mom has a solution. Online homeschool.\n\nI think online homeschool can be done well and I don't think my mom was malicious. I truly and honestly think she wanted the best for me, but fuck me this was this not the way to go. I stayed at home every day all year round while, submerged my self in all sorts of media and, on a more positive note, did good with the little amount of school work I had to do. but most importantly I isolated myself in my room, and didn't talk to anyone for large periods of times, not even people online. I feel like this messed with my psyche a lot. I mean, imagine next to no experiences (in the form of personal ones, not learned ones) from the ages of 11-14. Maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of it than it is, but either way, that period of my life has shaped me into the absolutely worthless fucking human being I am now. \n\nI've tried going back to school in person multiple times in middle school, and now highschool, and It's not worked out too well. I just can't effectively communicate ideas talking to people, and I struggle a lot with figuring out what people mean in writing and when they're speaking to me. I'm overall really stupid and lazy because of the lack of challenge I've had throughout my entire, even before I went to online homeschool, but I've gotten really good at gaming academics and speak in stilted language so a lot of people at my school and my age in general think I'm smart, in that sort of stereotypically autistic way. It's cringe, I'm cringe and so many of my interactions as result are very awkward. I genuinely hate myself too, I mean really hate myself, and it's done me 0 favors since now I have a much more negative identity which makes me want to be a edgelord. And usually I temper myself, but it's become much more difficult in the past year due to being right back in the same situation I was before in online school with covid and all, and of course that's caused my mental health to decline drastically. Leading me to the present actually.\n\nIf you haven't noticed too, there are a lot of details I've been leaving out and gaps in my recantation, and it's due to a lot of factors, but primarily depression and ???????. I have this sort of bizarre pesudo-state way of describing what happens in my mind, and it makes formulating what I feel into words fairly difficult, since if I stated it the way I usually think about it would soubd very strange and like I was talking about some sort of fantasy government, which it is. The other major reason is because my memory and ability to recall events has been damaged by depression and anxiety, which I've struggled with for years along all the other bullshit I've managed to do to myself. Point of all this being that this might all seem strange. (I'm not autistic by the way). Anyway on to the part that makes this post appropriate for the subreddit.\n\nI'm 16 years old right now, and I'm going to kill myself tonight because I'm tired of the things I put myself through, and my repeated inability to deal with them. My parents are going away, and I have everything I need to pass peacefully and cleanly. I love my parents, but I don't want them to see me when I eventually become the deadbeat dipshit that I feel like I'm doomed to become if I keep living. I'm sorry for what they'll go through and I'm sorry for everyone I'll hurt. But this cannot go on anymore. I'll be here for a few hours after I post this, and then I'm attempting.",

I've just found myself sliding back into terrible levels of apathy and agony, finding it harder to enjoy the simple things in life and near impossible to attend classes or take basic care for myself. I don't have the strength to kill myself or the strength to heal and move on; so here I am, just waiting and rotting. I dream sometimes, that I have a way out of this mess and can make my way in life.

Music and sleep are my two only escapes now, minus here.\n\nIt just feels like I'm in purgatory, not dead but not alive either, just waiting to pass on.

I don't if this was a manic episode or something else I know that nobody could possibly suffers more than me. I wouldn't wish even to my worst enemy to go through such a thing. \n\nThe last six months there is not a day I stay home eventhough I wanted so much. Everyday I walk for miles, I sit alone on dirty benches with only company stray dogs, I drink the same coffee which I hate it and then I spent every night until very late in my mom's car. I have forgotten to eat like a normal person in my house because I eat the same crap food in the car everyday. I barely bathe myself and I used to wear the same 4 5 clothes everyday. My glasses have problem and I can't see well, my shoes are scratched, I have multiple problems with my back, sometimes I was sure I would fade out but I don't care. Every night is a living nightmare, I sweat constantly and go to the bathroom at least 30 times because I have irritable bowel and I keep neglect medical help. I also suspect that I have a rare syndrome due to my extensive use of cortisol but again I don't do anything about it. \n\nI don't know really why I treat myself this way. I used to think that my ocd is responsible for all of these rituals because everytime I'm afraid that something bad is gonna happen if I don't do certain things but recently as lockdown stopped I was able to stop many of my rituals quite easily. My family was always kind of dysfunctional but through  r\/raisedbynarcissists and some articles I realized how much damaged they did to me and I truly believe that my cruel self punishment comes from here. \n\nI can't believe how many months have passed and I'm still like that. I didn't understand that  Christmas or Easter or my birthday have passed because everyday is the same. I look my  books, my drawings and cry because I want so much to start over again. I want to clean my room, my clothes, to spent a quiet evening with reading and music. I want to write something, to sleep and take care of myself. I want to be healthy again, stop eating crap food and not be obese anymore. I have lost so many opportunities, some classes I wanted to attend, movies i wanted to watch, things I wanted to buy. My life never was good but this sick situation is a whole new level. \n\nI feel so tired. My body hurts but my soul is totally damaged. Every night I spend 2 3 hours in balcony thinking to jumb. I waste my time scrolling here reading other people's stories who feel proud of themselves over the tiniest achievements and I can't understand why I punish myself when I have prove in the past that I'm capable to handle very difficult situations. Why I have the need from others to tell me how strong I am? \n\nI'm sorry for my rambling I know that nobody is gonna answer me either way, I just want to share my suffering because I don't have anyone to support me. I can't find a way to start again my life I don't have energy anymore to try and I know that sooner or later I will end up worst. I don't want to die but I can't find other solution. I can't stand anymore the pain I feel when I know that my own mother who I used to believe that she loves me and cares about me she still judge me, neglect me and every moment she don't forget to remind me what a burden I'm and how much I tired her. Of course this is not excuse to become violent towards her but I still do it out of anger and I hit myself also many times. \n\nIt's such a shame because I really had dreams and ambitions but I'm tired being to nice with people and all I got all these years from everyone is rejection. How to love yourself when literally everybody whole my life classmates, teachers, therapists, friends, parents, strangers treated me like a garbage and invalidated me? The only good thing I can do for myself is to get rid of me as soon as possible. \n\nPs. The last two weeks things changed a lot and I had to adjust my toxic routine because lockdown was over. I managed to stop some of my compulsions but I still can't find a way to help myself. I go out with my mom for shopping, to a caf\u00e9 etc. and she pretents like nothing happened all these months. I walked on the crowed streets and I feel lost, my social anxiety is getting out of control again and I feel suffocated.

I just cry and I hate it.\n\nI feel like there\u2019s no way to help me. I\u2019m just broken. Honest to God, I\u2019ve tried so so hard to feel myself. But it\u2019s all temporary distractions. Doomed to feel this way until I see with my own eyes my older brother become a functioning adult. And I feel like it\u2019s slowly eating away at me. I just want to stop feeling horrible. I want everything to just be okay.",
        "60":"I\u2019ve known this for quite some time but I have to remind myself more often than not. I have no family, no friends, no one to love because heck why lower your standards to be with me? I\u2019ve been bullied most of my life by my family, \u2018friends\u2019. I\u2019ve always been the punchline of everyone\u2019s joke at the dinner table and at the school canteen. I was molested by my cousin, punched by my male neighbour, had a heavy dictionary thrown at me. Been choked by my sister, sat on by my other sister. I\u2019ve been spat on by my mum twice, threatened by my older brothers. Been told many times that I don\u2019t matter, that I\u2019m not normal; no one has ever defended me. And I really believe them, I really don\u2019t like me. I hate me. I ask God why did you make me? What a waste of a human life, I will gladly give my soul to a miscarried baby or someone\u2019s sweet grandma who passed away. If I could, I\u2019ll let them live instead of me. I don\u2019t want to kill myself but I don\u2019t want to exist, I want to fade away. 11th of February 1998 should mean nothing to everybody. I\u2019m really sorry that you had to read this, as I\u2019m crying but my whole life, I\u2019ve either been neglected or abused. No one in my family seems to think so, that\u2019s okay why should they even care about a non-person like myself. \n\n\n(I\u2019m all emotional because my cat is unwell, he\u2019s gone blind and everyone in the house is blaming me)",

Didn't fix the depression and now I just have more stuff to get depressed over.\n\nRecently, got rejected from a program that would have me work over seas. I asked my best friend out a couple months ago, got rejected. Became much better friends after that though. later, found out she has a thing for an old hs friend that lives out of state, and a vacation we planned together was in large part so she can hook up with this friend. So, I'm no longer going to do that trip.\n\nI have a lot of other stuff going on, but those are some things I had hope for recently. This year I gave myself a hard deadline for when I would finally end it, created a plan, everything. Decided to do it after graduation, so a couple weeks from now. Unfortunately tho, my friend convinced me to stick around for a while (I opened up to her about my depression after we started getting really close. Asshole thing to do, I know). Now I can't even connect to that suicidal part of me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Planned on ending things, finally gave myself a hard deadline. So many things I was looking forward to turned out bad.

        "74":"Here are my two cents about what doesn't do jack shit about depression. But first let me give you a story about what 'awakened' my demons. \n\nI've tried two types of therapy for my anxiety\/depression issues that were severely exacerbated by condition called CPPS (Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome) that I had to endure for 7 months. It started it 2020. Thankfully I am mostly over it.  This condition has no known cure cure, and you can only pray that it goes away on its own. Most ppl become suicidal due to this condition since it affects your life severely. Symptoms that it causes : urinary frequency (every 5mins you get the urge), inability to defecate (anal muscles are spasmed, pooping takes 1 hour and is incomplete,),urinary hesitancy, sexual dysfunction (blood cant flow into the penis due to spasm in pelvic floor), severe pain\/burning in urethra\/groin\/testicles. \n\nI've been to psychotherapy to sort of cope with this since it is recommended but also for the 'old demons' of regular depression - &gt; \"nothing provides joy\". \n\nSince most of you have the kind of depression that doesn't stem from CPPS but rather \"nothing provides joy\" kind I will touch on that. \n\nPsychotherapy is bullshit for that kind of depression. \nI've tried two types:REBT and Psychodynamic. \n\nPsychodynamic  : I had sessions 2\/3 times a week. It is quite expensive when you have that kind of frequency. The psychotherapist interprets what you say and 'guides you' to come up to your own conclusions. It is pure bullshit, because there is no 'guide' on how to overcome the issues, and at the end of the day the conclusion that you will inevitably come up with is that nothing provides joy which you've already known. \n\nREBT: this type of therapy is supposed to help you by identifying distorted thoughts and correcting them. This has some merit for ppl who have mild anxiety\/depression since mildly depressed ppl have it probably due to distorted thoughts e. g. I am fat and I will forever be ugly and nobody will love me. \nHowever there are no distorted thoughts in severe depression. You literally just have nothing that provides joy. You could argue that it is logical error since you haven't tried everything. However if you tried a bunch of stuff and nothing gives you joy then a clear pattern is formed that indicates that it is very unlikely that 'next new thing' will be any different. Also you could argue that severely depressed person doesn't have the motivation to even try anything so that argument puts the nail on the coffin. \n\nI've also tried SSRIs. They are bullshit, they didn't help one tiny bit. They caused a bunch of side effects and one possibly permanent side effect. They caused: weight gain and loss of libido. \n\nLoss of libido is still present even though I reduced my dose to minimal. I have zero libido\nIt is likely that I developed PSSD (Post SSRI sexual dysfunction) - dysfunction that doesn't go away even tho you quit antidepressant and can last indefinitely. \n\nMy advice to people who have severe depression is to ask psychiatrist about antidepressants that don't cause loss of libido (Wellbutrin), or about MAOI these can cause it but it is much more rare (as far as I know) and are much better when it comes to severe depression.Do your own research about MAOI since I can't vouch about it not causing sexual dysfunction but I think I'm right. \nAlso Ketamine\/Spravato is recommended for treatment resistant depression, and I think it doesn't cause sexual dysfunction. \nMagic shrooms\/Psylocibin is new treatment that seems promising for severe depression. \n\nPsychotherapy will just be a waste of time and money in my opinion if you suffer from severe depression. I am fucking angry that I even wasted my fucking money on it. Especially the psychodynamic one that doesn't even have any scientific data showing it is effective. It is not even in the domain of science since it isn't falsifiable. I should've done my fucking homework. \n\nHope this helps you and saves you some money.",

        "77":"  \n\nThis is probably the first time ever that I opened up my depression to someone else. It\u2019s probably gonna be really long, so someone might not finish this. And English is not my first language you see, so there would be a lot of mistake and my choice of words and sentences might be not really good.\n\nI just feel so tired right now. So I\u2019m from South-East Asia and in here, parents\u2019 words are very important and it is just the tradition here. It is almost impossible to change now for me. So during Covid-19 I come home to live with my parents because I\u2019m 22, don\u2019t have a job, still in college with not very good grade. I keep trying u know help around the house, housework. But for all things you do, they will all down fall to just one mistake. Then here come \u201cThese day, you are doing nothing. All you is eat. Not helping around\u2026\u201d much more. I did tried talk back a few things only to worsen the mood. I just don\u2019t what to do to please them.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, my parents have to become worker in South-Korea to make money to support family. During that time, kids grow very slowly. I didn\u2019t feel much at first. Without knowing, I start to feel distant from everyone. I start to be by myself more and more. I can\u2019t focus on my study. And when I fail one test with was quite important but won\u2019t affect my final grade, it was a hard fall. I just can\u2019t get up. \n\nIn college, it just got worsen. My memory start failing my choice of subject is completely off. Interior design for one year was a no because it is expensive and not my type of thing to do. IT third now, my mind is now just tired. I can\u2019t focus. I should have choose Foreign Language. But now I\u2019m scared cause I\u2019m using my parents\u2019 money for college payment. And it is third year now. I feel like a complete failure and really afraid to talk to my parents about it.  What to do?\n\nIdk why but I\u2019m really scared of getting a job even a part time. I can hardly breathe when thinking about moving forward to try new things. And I\u2019m not close to my friend as before as I start to get depression.\n\nI\u2019m gay but I never open up about it. No one know I am one except for one of my friend but he was really rich and hanging out with him just feel so awkward. I only had one crush in high school which I confessed him when I\u2019m in college which was failure. And I haven\u2019t speak to him since. So I never really been in relationship. Maybe I can find one?? Nahhh I\u2019m not a good looking guy, too tall to be a bottom, too skiny ( I have been in the same 48 kg for 5 years now never gain any weight). Gym? I just don\u2019t have time and feel really embarrassed about going. I am too afraid to be in a real relationship.\n\nI\u2019m a very boring person. I\u2019m bored of things really fast even game. I can\u2019t chat for long. I start feel bored and run out of topic to talk about really fast which make me afraid of chatting with someone else cause I\u2019m afraid I might upset them.\n\nSo this is it. Thank you guys for reading this. There are a lot more but these are things that are mainly really not in good way right now. Also I\u2019m feel much better while writing this which make me really sleepy. I did think of suicide a couple time but never get to do it. Thank guys!!",

My own mother doesn't even say \"I love you\" to me and it makes me feel as if she doesn't really care for me as much since I was an only child. She won't even talk to me unless I have some sort of missing assignment in class that I'm already stressing about, and she makes it worse by constantly yelling at me about it. I've been getting bullied a lot on social media and at school. A lot of people told me to just end it and I'll admit I have had thoughts about it, but then I think of some of the people that really care about me and how it could gravely impact their life, so I just get really upset knowing I could ruin someone else's life. I've been getting less and less sleep everyday to the point where I don't sleep at all. Sometimes I won't even eat because I'm not in the mood for it. I started taking less care of myself too because I always just think \"there's no point in doing it at this point.\" A lot of this stress makes me just breakdown and people think I'm \"overdramatic\" or that I'm just faking it for attention. I've asked my friends what to do, they always just say \"get over it\" and \"you're fine.\" Is there anything I can do to at least bring my stress down?",

        "106":"Let me just say my relationship with my father went downhill when I was about 8.  He was having problems with his own parents and that created problems within our relationship.  I was a daddy's girl before then.\n\nThe actual 'verbal abuse' started in the beginning of the 7th grade.  I'd turned 13 and started wearing black band tees and chopped my hair at about shoulder length (parents thought it was too short but were ok with it for the time being) anyways, the first 2 months of school that year became a total nightmare.  My dad started suddenly telling me that I looked like a weirdo and that kids at school probably saw me that way to.  He'd give long lectures about my style and how no ones gonna wanna marry a girl who dresses the way I do, but the way he spoke to me always felt like the way a father would speak to his rebelious son.  Just his tone and constant swearing.  Idk.  Btw my sister was the one who got me into that emo style\/culture and actually sported a haircut similar to mine, but much longer, so she didn't get much of the same treatment. \n\nAnd I mean, I get it.  Even I still cringe at the style I had back then, but looking back, I don't think the way he spoke to me was the way a father should ever speak to his own daughter.  I wonder if he acts that way towards me because maybe he wishes he had a son, but instead ended up with me?  Everyone did assume I'd be a boy before my mom had me.  I am also certainly the tomboy of the sisters. Maybe that says something?  Either way, I hate the way he speaks to me.  He has often told me I should be more feminine and whatnot.  Not in a creepy way but in more of a \"why can't you just be a normal daughter\" type of way.  How can I feel feminine when you make fun of my style, call me a \"fucking weirdo\", constantly tell me to \"be normal\" and ask me if theres something wrong with me mentally?  A lot of kids go through stupid phases, but both my parents, mainly dad, made me feel as though it was much deeper than that.  I remember them telling me \"you'll never be successful if you continue dressing that way\".  They were truly disappointed in me.  A 13 year old girl, still going through puberty, starting to compare herself to other girls, starting to have her own insecurities, and on top of that... having her own father insult her looks and speak to her as though he's speaking with a grown man, thinking that maybe it'll get her to stop dressing that way and finally be normal.  Let's just say it made me look and feel even less feminine. \n\nI ended up cutting my hair into a pixie (kept the bangs long due to insecurities) and my parents went completely bonkers.  Yes it was kinda bonkers and I was just a stupid kid, but their insults after that just made me feel even worse.  They started telling me I looked like a boy.  \"Why are you trying to look like a boy?\"  \"If you think you're ugly, why make yourself look worse?\"  \"Are you mentally ill?  Is that why you dress that way\"  \"Do you know what a dyke is?  Well you look like one.\", most of the insults coming from my dad.  He then one day asked me in front of everyone if I was a lesbian.  I said no and he accused me of lying.  I ran to my room crying, only to have mom come in and ask me the same question once more, but in a calmer tone. No, I'm not a lesbian! Stop asking! \n\nThe tip on the icing was when I was sitting on the couch watching tv, my dad came and sat on the other sofa, mom was in living room to btw.  Few seconds later he tells me, \"Do you know the short hair makes you look fat?\"  My mom defended me and told him to stop and that he shouldn't say that.  It's funny cuz I had kinda thought I was chubby, as most young girls do, but he pretty much confirmed it for me in my mind.  I ditched the t shirts and wore only sweaters after that to cover myself. He then starts calling me \"sweater girl\". Kinda funny...until he went out of his way to actually BURN one of my sweaters. And everyone laughed. What's also funny is that I'd seen pictures of me at that age and I was thin, never fat. Guess that was just his way of trying to yet again convince me to \"be normal\".\n\nThe thing is, I know he loves me very much. But he has issues controlling his anger and has his own insecurities, as well as problems with his own parents, specifically his mother. It makes him say the stupidest things. I just wish he was strong enough to have not had it affect our relationship. Because it's truly what's caused so much pain in my own life that wouldn't be there otherwise, like my social anxiety, my depression, the fact that I've been homeschooled for 4 years since I was 14,  all because I couldn't stand being around people anymore.  Everyday is the same day for me.  Every week is the same for me.  I don't go out.  I have no friends.  I'm am alone.\n\nI know this is long. I just really needed to vent this out somewhere.

        "113":"Not sure if this belongs here or in a different sub or of it even belongs in a sub at all...if anyone has suggestions on where else to put this mess of a post let me know and I'll take it down.\n\nI recently went to the dentist after 3 years. I was never great at taking care of my teeth (mostly due to mental health reasons), and I avoided going to the dentist because of anxiety. Well, turns out I need a lot of dental work done. I have multiple cavities (more than 10), need two crowns, had a root canal and possibly might need another root canal for a different tooth. I decided to start all this work because I wanted to be more confident in my self and in my smile, but it's having the opposite effect.\n\nThree weeks ago I had fillings done on 3\/4ths of my mouth. Ever since then my bite has just been off. Everytime I close my mouth to chew something they feel like they knock into each other. I've gone to my dentist at least 4 times to get them adjusted but he never adjusts them right. I tell him while I'm in the chair that they are still off and he basically tells me to deal with it. Last week I went in everyday to get them adjusted and I'm still stuck with pain and the inability to chew or close my mouth.\n\nOne of my teeth had an infection for nine months. I was dealing with it, but needed a root canal. A few days ago my dentist thought that the pain I was having from the bad adjustments on the fillings was due to the pain of the infected tooth, so he scheduled me an emergency root canal. I'm now in pain from that, plus I'm still in pain from the badly adjusted fillings. \n\nI still need the two crowns (one being on the tooth with the root canal I just had done) and the last 1\/4th of my cavities done. I might also need another root canal for a different tooth.\n\nI haven't eaten solid food in 3 weeks. I've broken down in tears and had panic attacks every other, and sometimes every day, from the pain of my teeth and the frustration of not being able to eat real food. My boyfriend asks me if I want to get pizza or some other solid food and I have to say no even though I want that food so bad. I know the minute I start chewing and those fillings hit each other, I know I'll be in intense pain so therefore I can't eat solid food. I'm so sick of applesauce, yogurt, pudding, mashed potatoes and ice cream. It's been three weeks and I just want to eat some real food. I've lost 10 pounds because I'm not getting the proper nutrients for my body no matter how much food I eat. \n\nLet's add in the financial stress too. I'm 23 and on state insurance so basically nothing is covered and I'm paying for this out of pocket. My parents refuse to help and I just graduated college last year. With COVID, I'm unable to get a job in my field so I'm stuck working a minimum wage job that I don't even want to go to anymore because I'm so depressed and in pain from my teeth.\n\nI also work night shift and my dentist is only open 9-5, which is when I sleep. So, I've been getting very little sleep in an attempt to try and make my teeth better and to not be in pain. The fact that I have to keep going to the dentist daily is making me lose sleep and lose my mind.\n\nI'm also ruining my relationship with my boyfriend because all I do is complain to him about my teeth or that my teeth hurt. Even when I don't mean to. He knows something is wrong and everytime intell him it's my teeth he does a big sigh and I can tell he's sick of me telling him. When I have mental breakdowns because of it, I know he is just comforting me because he has no other choice. I feel so bad because I'm being a horrible girlfriend who just wants to cry and complain about my teeth. I haven't been intimate or spent any time with him because of the mental state I'm in and because of the pain I'm in. It's only a matter of time before he breaks up with me over this.\n\nI'm so sick of my teeth, I honestly sometimes wish that they would just be knocked out of my face so I didn't have to deal with them and the stress they are causing me. They have caused me more harm than good. They hurt, they're causing me not to be able to eat properly, they're ruining my sleep schedule, they're ruining my finances, they're ruining my relationship with my boyfriend and they're ruining my mental health. I'm mentally drained and I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up crying because of all the harm they've done to my life in the past few months. Like during my breakdowns I have suicidal thoughts over this stress of my teeth. (Want to disclose that I'm not feeling suicidal right now, but in the past have been suicidal over my teeth and got help for it).

        "119":"I've been seeing my therapist monthly for several years. My husband and I also see an LMFT bi-weekly and have been for the past year-ish. Our LMFT suggested I ask for more frequent appointments with my therapist, which I agreed to do. Unfortunately, at my last appointment with my therapist (29 April), right as I was about to ask, he apologized saying he did not have even a half hour open in May, so offered 8 June. I agreed to that because he mentioned scheduling \"...for my more needy patients,\" implying I'm not one of those. I still felt discouraged, sad, and cried after that appointment because one of the last things he told me was \"you miss your partner,\" and it hit hard how much I miss my husband. (see note at bottom)\n\nNow earlier in April, my therapist offered me a 30 minute call out of the blue saying \"I know you don't have any support so here I am,\" which moved me almost to tears because I know he has a lot of patients. I work for the same organization just in a different department, and have my own patients to keep track of so I understand the stress it can cause. Perhaps I am incorrect in assuming I would be seen more frequently if he thought I needed it. I know I need to communicate this, I'm just not sure how. I also feel fearful of becoming a needy patient.\n\nJust FYI, my husband is in military training and will be away for at least a year. Our home is an 8-10 hour flight from any friends or family, which is also how far his training is from me. I have MDD, insomnia, and recently diagnosed ADD\/ADHD.

People putting other lives in danger because they don\u2019t believe in science. People trying to sabotage others careers because they don\u2019t like them. The fall of humanity will be by humanity itself due to its inability to come together. Now this post will go unnoticed as per fucking usual.",
        "122":"Like this place is a place for death notes and normal depressed people activities. Who joins this place to hear about the trending articals from suicidal ppl?",
        "123":"There are a lot of things I can do.\n\nI can go play a video game or watch a show.\n\nI can talk to friends.\n\nI can work.\n\nI can study\n\nI can go out to eat\n\nAny of these things might make you feel good for a minute. Then they end, and you return to your baseline feeling.\n\nIf that baseline feeling is self loathing, existential dread or boredom then what's the point?\n\nEvery possible activity is fleeting. I feel like life is a series of distractions, then I turn the monitor off or go sit on my bed and I realize I've felt the same way for a decade. I don't see any point in it anymore.\n\nI could move or switch degrees or fix my addiction or try and meet people. At the end of the day I'd sit on my bed and feel the same. If its all just distracting yourself until you die, why do anything? Nothing lasts.",
        "124":"Jeez I have not been here in awhile I definitely should have revisited sooner. Honestly life didn\u2019t get much better a couple of advances but mostly things are still static. I started a delivery job at my uncle\u2019s restaurant and it\u2019s been paying well, I\u2019ve saved up enough to maintain my car, help with rent, and even buy my own ticket for Morocco.\n\nIt sounds great but I\u2019ve also been lying to all of my friends and coworkers that I\u2019m attending school. To the point that I\u2019m making lies about days I can\u2019t work to make it more believable. I sent my application for school way too late and haven\u2019t received a response back. in my parents eyes I wasted a year, because I didn\u2019t go to school right after. I\u2019m now scrambling to try to apply to the community college and get my shit together. And by scrambling i mean keeping it in the back of my mind until I eventually crash and burst out on the wrong person, or actually apply. I can\u2019t even lie to myself and say I\u2019m trying my best.\n\nI went out for ftour (breaking fast for Ramadan) at the restaurant I work at and when we were cleaning up and trying to take our food home I got called fat by my coworker Alex for taking food home. \n\u201cHe\u2019s already 300lb why would he want more!?\u201d\nEven though I laughed it off and my uncle wanted to yell at him I just cleared the situation so nobody had to feel bad. But truly that shit hurt me, I couldn\u2019t ruin the night and it honestly pushed me to come back here. Almost a safe zone were I actually just let it out. I\u2019m having thoughts of starving myself and as horrible as it seems I\u2019m honestly thinking about it as a viable option. I\u2019m gonna attempt to wake up in the morning to go to the gym and try to work out again after not going for more than a month. \n\nShit was simple and god do I miss it, I see my friends who are the same age as me, and coworkers younger then me with a future already started or already laid out for them and I\u2019m just gasping for air trying to catch up. I\u2019ve been playing way to many video games lately and I want to attempt a week break although it will be hard I think it will reset me mentally. Of course this is a lot of motivation and shit talking from an overweight dude at 3am but I have to talk to someone. My parents are too old and don\u2019t have an understanding of where I am and it will only make me feel worse from their textbook response, my sister has her own life there\u2019s no need for me to ruin it with a stupid rant, she has enough on her plate. I need to fucking get it together or my life is worthless. If I don\u2019t get it together then killing myself would be the best option, as extreme as it sound, no weight is better then dead weight.",
        "125":"I've had suicidal thoughts before. but they're usually intrusive thoughts, not something I would consider. one of my biggest fears was killing myself out of impulse. throwing everything away because of a couple bad thoughts. and now I'm here. I have no friends. I cant talk to anyone. and now I'm actually considering it. I really just don't know what to do.",
        "126":"i am so pathetic. i don\u2019t see any way i will be able to amount to something in this world, and it is too painful to get through each day let alone try my odds. i wish i could quit smoking, work harder, be nicer to people, but everything is so hard when the only thing on my mind is death."
